AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the worlds most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsImpact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."" Segments AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.

It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. Orilissa inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Outside the United States, Orilissa is also launched in Canada. Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) is a combination prescription medicine used to control heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids in women before menopause. Other women's health. Other women's health includes Liletta, a sterile, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to six years. Other key products. AbbVies other key products include, among other things, treatments for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), metabolic and hormone products that target a number of conditions, including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism, as well as endocrinology products for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate 2021 Form 10-K |  cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. These products are: Mavyret/Maviret.

It is also indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and following the EXPEDITION-8 study, also in patients with compensated cirrhosis who are new to treatment. Creon. Creon (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions. Lupron. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and Lupron Depot, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection. Linzess/Constella. Linzess (linaclotide) is a once-daily guanylate cyclase-C agonist used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBSC) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). The product is marketed as Linzess in the United States and as Constella outside of the United States. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AbbVie has the rights to sell Creon and Synthroid only in the United States. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AbbVie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 37% of AbbVie's 2021 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies |  2021 Form 10-K and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional (small-molecule) pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVies competitors could cause revenues for AbbVies products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVies biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVies intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a patent term restoration, for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for 2021 Form 10-K |  individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDAs reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVies business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the companys business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018. In addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVies employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. |  2021 Form 10-K Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other ArrangementsOther Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other ArrangementsOther Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVies existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:  Phase 1 involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases.  Phase 2 tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.  Phase 3 tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval. Preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. 2021 Form 10-K |  The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products, delivery devices, and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA. Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses along with other labeling restrictions. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial. |  2021 Form 10-K The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). RegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In 2021 Form 10-K |  addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2022 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is difficult to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. |  2021 Form 10-K Regulation  Medical Devices Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVies medical device product candidates, including AbbVies breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market. United States . AbbVies medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVies medical device products, including AbbVies breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVies subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device. Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses along with other labeling restrictions. European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformit Europenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVies ability to market and sell AbbVies products in these countries. 2021 Form 10-K |  Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were approximately $17 million and operating expenditures were approximately $33 million. In 2022, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $14 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $34 million. Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 50,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2022. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Human Capital Management Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on peoples lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission. Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVies continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access and business development. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices. New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. AbbVie's mentorship program allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees career and development goals. AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities to all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, the foundation to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development |  2021 Form 10-K Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities. Culture. AbbVies shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVies mission of making a remarkable impact on peoples lives. Equity, Equality, Diversity  Inclusion (EEDI). A cornerstone of AbbVies human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. In 2019, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity  Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVies senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. In recent years, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through December 2021, women represented 51 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 35 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2020. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie recently launched a new resource for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of EEDI to the business, educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior, and encourage participation in the company's inclusive culture learning opportunities. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community, hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities. In 2021, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by, among other things, expanding its employee matching program to $3-to-$1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity. Additional information about AbbVie's efforts on racial equality and social justice is provided on the company's website at: https://abbvie.com/our-company/equality-inclusion-diversity/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html. COVID-19 Health and Safety. AbbVie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to drive strong business performance. AbbVie implemented, among other things, temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures; regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on AbbVie's business and employees; establishment of physical distancing procedures, modification of workspaces and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees; provision of on-site vaccinations and temperature screenings; a variety of testing and vaccination resources including on-site vaccinations and on-site and at-home testing and COVID case management programs; and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees needs for flexibility. In addition, COVID-19 is a covered event under the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund's Employee Relief Program, entitling eligible AbbVie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance. AbbVie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the company's employees with relevant medical, pharmaceutical, research and development, science, public health and public safety skills, knowledge, training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic. Lastly, AbbVies commitment to employees has been evidenced by no workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with COVID-19 . Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( investors.abbvie.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( investors.abbvie.com ). 2021 Form 10-K |  "," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVies operations and financial condition. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVies operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVies employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVies employees, patients, customers and business partners. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVies operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVies operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessIntellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings."" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. |  2021 Form 10-K AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. Humira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in  The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVies future revenues and operating earnings  above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, 2021 Form 10-K |  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding Humiracould adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVies biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVies biologic products, AbbVies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products |  2021 Form 10-K and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVies products, and this could negatively impact AbbVies business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Certain aspects of AbbVies operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVies oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVies operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be 2021 Form 10-K |  taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVies recently acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergans textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVies business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, ""Legal Proceedings and Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. |  2021 Form 10-K AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development, BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing, and BusinessRegulationMedical Devices. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 23% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  international trade disruptions or disputes;  difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 2021 Form 10-K |   political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic;  sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  restrictions on transfers of funds;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. |  2021 Form 10-K AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. In particular, AbbVie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of Allergan. AbbVies substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, AbbVies business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVies or third-party providers databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVies balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, have increased significantly. Such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. A significant amount of AbbVies total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of AbbVies developed product rights and other intangible assets was $76.0 billion and the carrying value of AbbVies goodwill was $32.4 billion. AbbVies developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. AbbVies other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and AbbVies IPRD intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPRD impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. 2021 Form 10-K |  Failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVies ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVies success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract, develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (RD), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;  environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVies manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials;  changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie;  business interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and  changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. |  2021 Form 10-K In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the worlds most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2021 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2021 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.2 billion, operating earnings of $17.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.45 and cash flows from operations of $22.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 23% on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care portfolios as well as a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share in 2021 was $6.45 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $948 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPRD); (iv) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC; (v) $307 million for milestones and other research and development (RD) expenses; (vi) $253 million for charges related to litigation matters; and (vii) $215 million of acquisition and integration expenses. These costs were partially offset by $265 million of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVies pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVies on-market brands. In October 2021, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share of common stock payable in February 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022 . 2021 Form 10-K |  To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. AbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines. 2022 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:  Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth.  Hematologic oncology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Venclexta, as well as maintaining the strong leadership position of Imbruvica.  Aesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.  Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and recently launched Qulipta.  Sustaining eye care leadership by maximizing AbbVie's current eye care portfolio.  The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2022. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. |  2021 Form 10-K Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Skyrizi  In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical trials of Skyrizi in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.  In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE induction studies of Skyrizi in patients with Crohns disease met the primary and key secondary endpoints.  In April 2021, AbbVie received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Skyrizi in a single dose pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen. This approval will reduce the number of injections administered per treatment.  In June 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 FORTIFY study for Skyrizi in patients with moderate to severe Crohns disease met the co-primary endpoints.  In September 2021, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Skyrizi for the treatment of patients 16 years and older with moderate to severe Crohns disease.  In November 2021, AbbVie submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Skyrizi for the treatment of patients 16 years or older with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease who have had inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy.  In November 2021, Ab bVie announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Skyrizi alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active PsA in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  In January 2022, A bbVie announced that the FDA approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with active PsA. Rinvoq  In January 2021, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active PsA and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).  In February 2021, AbbVie announced its Phase 3 U-ACCOMPLISH induction study of Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.  In June 2021, AbbVie announced the FDA will not meet the Prescription Drug User Fee Act action dates for the sNDA of Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active AS. No formal regulatory action has been taken on the sNDA for Rinvoq in AS.  In June 2021, AbbVie announced the results from its Phase 3 maintenance study of Rinvoq in patients with UC met the primary and all secondary endpoints.  In August 2021, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 2021 Form 10-K |   In September 2021, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC.  In October 2021, A bbVie announced the results from Study 1 of the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial for Rinvoq in patients with active AS and inadequate response to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.  In October 2021, A bbVie announced the results from Study 2 of the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial for Rinvoq in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis met the primary and 12 of 14 ranked secondary endpoints.  In December 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 U-EXCEED induction study for Rinvoq in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to biologic therapy met the primary and key secondary endpoints.  In December 2021, AbbVie announced an update to the U.S. Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This update follows a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) issued by the FDA in September 2021 based on its final review of the post-marketing study evaluating another JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) in patients with RA. The DSC and this label update apply to the class of systematically administered FDA-approved JAK inhibitors for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases. Based on this class-wide update, the U.S. label for Rinvoq will now include additional information about risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings Precautions sections. The indication has also been updated to be indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.  In December 2021, A bbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active PsA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.  In January 2022, Abb Vie announced its submission of an sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  In January 2022, Ab bVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease did not respond to previous treatment and is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or when use of other pills or injections is not recommended.  In February 2022, AbbVie was notified that the EC is requesting the EMA to assess safety concerns associated with JAK inhibitor products authorized in inflammatory diseases and to evaluate the impact of these events on their benefit-risk balance. The assessment covers all JAK inhibitors approved for use in inflammatory diseases. The request is for an opinion from the EMA by September 30, 2022. Oncology Imbruvica  In June 2021, AbbVie announced results from its Phase 3 GLOW study comparing the efficacy and safety of Imbruvica in combination with Venclexta versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab for first-line treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma met its primary endpoint. Venclexta  In May 2021, AbbVie received European Commission approval for Venclyxto in combination with a hypomethylating agent for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. |  2021 Form 10-K  In July 2021, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for the potential treatment of adult patients with previously untreated intermediate-, high- and very high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Teliso-V  In January 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to investigational telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor wild type, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based therapy. Neuroscience Botox Therapeutic  In February 2021, AbbVie received FDA approval of Botox for the treatment of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition in certain pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.

Vraylar  In October 2021, A bbVie announced top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials, Study 3111-301-001 and Study 3111-302-001, evaluating the efficacy and safety of cariprazine (Vraylar) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In Study 3111-301-001, Vraylar met its primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant change from baseline to week six in the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score compared with placebo in patients with MDD. In Study 3111-302-001, Vraylar demonstrated numerical improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline to week six in MADRS total score compared with placebo but did not achieve statistical significance. Safety data were consistent with the established safety profile of Vraylar across indications with no new safety signals identified. ABBV-951  In October 2021, Abb Vie announced that results from its pivotal Phase 3 M15-736 study of ABBV-951 (foslevodopa/foscarbidopa) in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease met its primary endpoint in a 12-week study. Eye Care Vuity  In October 2021, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Vuity (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) for the treatment of presbyopia. 2021 Form 10-K |  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis. Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2021 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets. |  2021 Form 10-K Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 2% in 2021 as a result of modest favorable pricing in the United States and increased collaboration revenues, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and share loss in the United States. Net revenues for Venclexta increased 34% in 2021 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML. Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics increased 98% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics increased by more than 100% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas increased 75% in 2021 due to a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression increased 82% in 2021 due to higher market share and market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily due to increased volume and market share uptake since launch in 2020. Net revenues for Mavyret decreased 8% in 2021 primarily driven by the continued disruption of global HCV markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Gross margin $ 38,751 $ 30,417 $ 25,827 27 % 18 % as a percent of net revenues 69 % 66 % 78 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 increased from 2020 primarily due to lower amortization of inventory fair value step-up adjustment associated with the Allergan acquisition and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the Allergan acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 12,349 $ 11,299 $ 6,942 9 % 63 % as a percent of net revenues 22 % 25 % 21 % SGA expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 decreased primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan as well as leverage from revenue growth and synergies realized in the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition. 2021 Form 10-K |  Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Research and development $ 7,084 $ 6,557 $ 6,407 8 % 2 % as a percent of net revenues 13 % 14 % 19 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 962 $ 1,198 $ 385 (20) % 100% RD expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to the increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized for the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan. Acquired IPRD expenses represent initial costs to acquire rights to in-process RD projects through RD collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPRD expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million as a result of exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and a charge of $370 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO Inc. for the development and commercialization of RGX-314, an investigational gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. Acquired IPRD expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPRD expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense in 2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 2,423 $ 2,454 $ 1,784 Interest income (39) (174) (275) Interest expense, net $ 2,384 $ 2,280 $ 1,509 Net foreign exchange loss $ 51 $ 71 $ 42 Other expense, net 2,500 5,614 3,006 Interest expense in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the companys floating rate debt obligations and deleveraging, partially offset by a higher average debt balance associated with the incremental Allergan debt acquired. Interest income in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates. Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $2.7 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in 2020. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2021, the change in fair value included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results. |  2021 Form 10-K Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 11% in 2021, negative 36% in 2020 and 6% in 2019. The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Cash flows provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 22,777 $ 17,588 $ 13,324 Investing activities (2,344) (37,557) 596 Financing activities (19,039) (11,501) 18,708 Operating cash flows in 2021 increased from 2020. Operating cash flows in 2021 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and lower acquisition-related cash expenses, partially offset by higher income tax payments and the timing of working capital cash flows. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVies contributions to its defined benefit plans of $376 million in 2021 and $367 million in 2020. Investing cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million. Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million. Financing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and 750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes. Financing cash flows also included the May 2021 repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes and the November 2021 repayment of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of 700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. 2021 Form 10-K |  No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings There were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, SP Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt. Future Cash Requirements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021: (in millions) Total Current Long-term Long-term debt, including current portion $ 75,962 $ 12,428 $ 63,534 Interest on long-term debt (a) 30,002 2,392 27,610 Contingent consideration liabilities (b) 14,887 1,249 13,638 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2021. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. |  2021 Form 10-K (b) Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the companys ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements. Income Taxes Future income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and is payable in five future annual installments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Quarterly Cash Dividend On October 29, 2021, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements AbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. 2021 Form 10-K |  Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, $27.0 billion in 2020 and $18.8 billion in 2019. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 95% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.

Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $3.6 billion in 2021, $2.4 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. |  2021 Form 10-K The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2021. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (90) $ 100 Projected benefit obligation (1,014) 1,159 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (7) $ 7 Projected benefit obligation (61) 69 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by $101 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in 2021 Form 10-K |  the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPRD acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPRD acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 as of December 31 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 10,253 1.155 $ 195 $ 7,818 1.213 $ (39) Chinese yuan 673 6.400 (1) 247 6.584 (1) British pound 605 1.331 9 275 1.341 3 Japanese yen 602 113.3 9 837 103.9 (7) Canadian dollar 571 1.258 9 591 1.328 (23) All other currencies 1,549 n/a 5 1,459 n/a (14) Total $ 14,253 $ 226 $ 11,227 $ (81) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2021, the company has 5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $244 million at December 31, 2021. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2021. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2021 Form 10-K |  "," ITEM 8.

Background The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are |  2021 Form 10-K typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (RD) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 2.1 billion in 2021, $ 1.8 billion in 2020 and $ 1.1 billion in 2019. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 2021 Form 10-K |  Investments Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Finished goods $ 932  $ 1,318  Work-in-process 1,193  1,201  Raw materials 1,003  791  Inventories $ 3,128  $ 3,310  Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Land $ 287  $ 288  Buildings 2,791  2,555  Equipment 6,850  6,976  Construction in progress 799  1,040  Property and equipment, gross 10,727  10,859  Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,617 ) ( 5,611 ) Property and equipment, net $ 5,110  $ 5,248  Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 803 million in 2021, $ 666 million in 2020 and $ 464 million in 2019. |  2021 Form 10-K Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease 2021 Form 10-K |  the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs to acquire rights to IPRD projects are expensed as IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPRD projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. RD costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. |  2021 Form 10-K Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 2,423  $ 2,454  $ 1,784  Interest income ( 39 ) ( 174 ) ( 275 ) Interest expense, net $ 2,384  $ 2,280  $ 1,509  Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Sales rebates $ 8,254  $ 7,188  Dividends payable 2,543  2,335  Accounts payable 2,882  2,276  Salaries, wages and commissions 1,785  1,669  Royalty and license arrangements 661  483  Other 6,574  6,208  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 22,699  $ 20,159  Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 13,638  $ 12,289  Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 5,970  5,680  Income taxes payable 3,442  3,847  Pension and other post-employment benefits 3,153  3,413  Other 2,498  2,378  Other long-term liabilities $ 28,701  $ 27,607  2021 Form 10-K |  Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Basic EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,542  $ 4,616  $ 7,882  Earnings allocated to participating securities 74  60  40  Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,468  $ 4,556  $ 7,842  Weighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding 1,770  1,667  1,481  Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.48  $ 2.73  $ 5.30  Diluted EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,542  $ 4,616  $ 7,882  Earnings allocated to participating securities 74  60  40  Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,468  $ 4,556  $ 7,842  Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,770  1,667  1,481  Effect of dilutive securities 7  6  3  Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding 1,777  1,673  1,484  Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.45  $ 2.72  $ 5.28  Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of Allergan On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination created a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $ 120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows: (in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a) $ 39,675  Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b) 23,979  Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c) 430  Total consideration $ 64,084  (a) Represents cash consideration transferred of $ 120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing. |  2021 Form 10-K (b) Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $ 83.96 per share. (c) Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders. The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the second quarter of 2021. Measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation during 2021 included (i) an increase to intangible assets of $ 710 million; (ii) an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $ 148 million; (iii) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $ 2 million; and (iv) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $ 564 million. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from the completion of the valuation of certain license agreement intangible assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations in 2021 and would not have had a significant impact on prior period results if these adjustments had been made as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes t he final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents $ 1,537  Short-term investments 1,421  Accounts receivable 2,374  Inventories 2,340  Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,982  Investments 137  Property and equipment 2,129  Intangible assets Definite-lived intangible assets 68,190  In-process research and development 1,600  Other noncurrent assets 1,395  Short-term borrowings ( 60 ) Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 1,899 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 5,852 ) Long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 18,937 ) Deferred income taxes ( 3,940 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 4,765 ) Total identifiable net assets 47,652  Goodwill 16,432  Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 64,084  The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $ 1.2 billion was amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory was sold to customers and was fully amortized as of December 31, 2021. Intangible assets relate to $ 68.2 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $ 1.6 billion of IPRD. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. 2021 Form 10-K |  The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $ 1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $ 10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $ 1.1 billion, inclusive of $ 4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and $ 1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $ 781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $ 103 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which were included in SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings . In the fourth quarter of 2021, AbbVie recovered certain acquisition-related regulatory fees totaling $ 401 million which was recorded as a reduction to SGA expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Net revenues $ 50,521  $ 49,028  Net earnings (loss) 6,746  ( 38 ) The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the final fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. Acquisition of Soliton, Inc. In December 2021, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Soliton, Inc. (Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the long-term improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $ 535 million paid to holders of Soliton common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date, AbbVie acquired $ 407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $ 63 million. Other assets and liabilities were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 177 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition of Luminera In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and RD pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $ 186 million was comprised of a $ 122 million upfront cash payment and $ 64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $ 33 million of intangible assets for developed |  2021 Form 10-K product rights. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.4 billion in 2021, $ 1.4 billion in 2020 and $ 1.1 billion in 2019. AbbVie recorded acquired IPRD charges of $ 962 million in 2021, $ 1.2 billion in 2020 and $ 385 million in 2019. Significant arrangements impacting 2021, 2020 and 2019, some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. Calico Life Sciences LLC In July 2021, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of their collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. This is the second collaboration extension and builds on the partnership established in 2014 and extended in 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $ 500 million and the term is extended for an additional three years. AbbVies contribution is payable in two equal installments beginning in 2023. Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2025 and will advance collaboration projects into Phase 2a through 2030. Following completion of the Phase 2a studies, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license the collaboration compounds. Upon exercise, AbbVie would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During the third quarter of 2021, AbbVie recorded $ 500 million as other operating expense in the consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement.

The company also repaid $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity in November 2021. 2021 Form 10-K |  In January 2022, the company repaid $ 2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.450 % senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2022. This repayment was made by exercising, under the terms of the notes, 60-day early redemption at 100% of the principal amount. In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, in May 2020, the company borrowed $ 3.0 billion under a $ 6.0 billion term loan credit agreement, of which $ 1.0 billion was outstanding under a floating rate three-year term loan tranche and $ 2.0 billion outstanding under a floating rate five-year term loan tranche as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. In May 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, AbbVie issued $ 14.0 billion and  3.1 billion of new notes in exchange for the Allergan notes tendered in the exchange offers. The aggregate principal amount of Allergan notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers was approximately $ 1.5 billion and  635 million. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of the assumed debt instruments. In May 2020, the company repaid $ 3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.5 % senior notes at maturity. In September 2020, the company repaid $ 650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 % senior notes at maturity. In November 2020, the company repaid  700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity and $ 450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875 % senior notes due February 2021 three months prior to maturity. In September 2019, the company issued  1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium and may redeem the senior notes at par between one and three months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 9 million and debt discounts totaled $ 5 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. In October 2019, the company used the proceeds to redeem  1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375 % senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019. In November 2019, the company issued $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. With exception of the fixed-rate notes due 2021 and 2022, AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 173 million and debt discounts totaled $ 52 million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the acquisition described in Note 5 and to pay related fees and expenses. AbbVie has outstanding $ 4.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2018.

AbbVie has outstanding $ 5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2012. AbbVie may redeem all of the senior notes of each series, at any time, or some of the senior notes of each series, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. |  2021 Form 10-K At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with its senior note covenants and term loan covenants. Short-Term Borrowings There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 1.8 % in 2020 and 2.5 % in 2019. In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $ 4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2021. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2021, 2020 and 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In March 2019, AbbVie repaid a $ 3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was drawn on in June 2018 and was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Maturities of Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes AbbVie's debt maturities as of December 31, 2021: as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) 2022 $ 12,428  2023 4,167  2024 7,219  2025 8,771  2026 6,000  Thereafter 37,377  Total obligations and commitments 75,962  Fair value hedges, unamortized bond premiums and discounts, deferred financing costs and finance lease obligations 708  Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations $ 76,670  Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. 2021 Form 10-K |  Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 1.5 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designed as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 750 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 8.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of  5.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and  6.6 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling  4.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and  971 million at December 31, 2020. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 4.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. |  2021 Form 10-K The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie's derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets: Fair value - Derivatives in asset position Fair value - Derivatives in liability position as of December 31 (in millions) Balance sheet caption 2021 2020 Balance sheet caption 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other $ 51  $ 2  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 2  $ 82  Designated as cash flow hedges Other assets     Other long-term liabilities   6  Designated as net investment hedges Prepaid expenses and other 149    Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   11  Designated as net investment hedges Other assets 15    Other long-term liabilities     Not designated as hedges Prepaid expenses and other 26  49  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 13  33  Interest rate swap contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other     Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 7  14  Designated as cash flow hedges Other assets     Other long-term liabilities   20  Designated as fair value hedges Prepaid expenses and other   7  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities     Designated as fair value hedges Other assets 26  131  Other long-term liabilities 15    Total derivatives $ 267  $ 189   $ 37  $ 166  While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company's counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones 2021 Form 10-K |  and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: 2021 2020 years ended December 31 (in millions) Range Weighted Average (a) Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.2 % - 2.6 % 1.7 % 0.1 % - 2.2 % 1.1  % Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 89 % - 100 % 90 % 56 % - 92 % 64  % Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56 % - 100 % 96 % 56 % - 100 % 91  % Projected year of payments 2022 - 2034 2021 - 2034 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2021 and 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2020. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the year-ended December 31, 2021, the company recorded a $ 2.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. During the year-ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded a $ 5.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and lower discount rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T RD program. |  2021 Form 10-K Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The 2020 actuarial losses of $ 1.1 billion for qualified pension plans and $ 40 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2019. AbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S. retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $ 397 million. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie assumed certain post-employment benefit obligations which were recorded at fair value. Upon acquisition in the second quarter of 2020, the excess of projected benefit obligations over the plan assets was recognized as a liability totaling $ 156 million. 2021 Form 10-K |  Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table summarizes the pre-tax losses (gains) included in other comprehensive income (loss): years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Defined benefit plans Actuarial loss (gain) $ ( 345 ) $ 701  $ 1,231  Amortization of prior service cost ( 2 ) ( 2 )   Amortization of actuarial loss ( 288 ) ( 227 ) ( 109 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) and other ( 27 ) 56  ( 6 ) Total loss (gain) $ ( 662 ) $ 528  $ 1,116  Other post-employment plans Actuarial loss $ 10  $ 40  $ 451  Prior service credit   ( 397 )   Amortization of prior service credit 39  4    Amortization of actuarial loss ( 32 ) ( 26 ) ( 1 ) Total loss (gain) $ 17  $ ( 379 ) $ 450  Net Periodic Benefit Cost years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Defined benefit plans Service cost $ 440  $ 370  $ 269  Interest cost 237  264  259  Expected return on plan assets ( 663 ) ( 575 ) ( 474 ) Amortization of prior service cost 2  2    Amortization of actuarial loss 288  227  109  Net periodic benefit cost $ 304  $ 288  $ 163  Other post-employment plans Service cost $ 48  $ 42  $ 25  Interest cost 19  34  29  Amortization of prior service credit ( 39 ) ( 4 )   Amortization of actuarial loss 32  26  1  Net periodic benefit cost $ 60  $ 98  $ 55  The components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2021 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 62.5 % in equity securities, 22.5 % in fixed income securities and 15 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2022 $ 293  $ 27  2023 312  30  2024 334  31  2025 356  34  2026 379  36  2027 to 2031 2,291  224  Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its eligible employees. The expense recognized for these plans was $ 267 million in 2021, $ 191 million in 2020 and $ 102 million in 2019. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation In May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. 2021 Form 10-K |  AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and the Amended Plan and is summarized as follows: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Cost of products sold $ 46  $ 47  $ 29  Research and development 226  247  171  Selling, general and administrative 420  459  230  Pre-tax compensation expense 692  753  430  Tax benefit 126  131  80  After-tax compensation expense $ 566  $ 622  $ 350  Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 50 million in 2021, $ 34 million in 2020 and $ 15 million in 2019. Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 16.28 in 2021, $ 12.14 in 2020 and $ 12.54 in 2019. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2021: (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,691  $ 73.90  4.7 $ 559  Granted 1,147  105.94  Exercised ( 4,278 ) 57.77  Lapsed and forfeited ( 186 ) 105.28  Outstanding at December 31, 2021 12,374  $ 81.98  4.7 $ 661  Exercisable at December 31, 2021 9,424  $ 78.03  3.6 $ 541  The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 239 million in 2021, $ 186 million in 2020 and $ 22 million in 2019. The total fair value of options vested during 2021 was $ 21 million. As of December 31, 2021, $ 10 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period. For awards granted in 2021 and 2020, performance is based on AbbVie's return on invested capital relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. For awards granted in 2019, the tranches tied to 2021 performance are based on AbbVies return on |  2021 Form 10-K equity relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVies EPS achievement and AbbVies total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVies common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2021: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,918  $ 87.03  Granted 7,556  105.79  Vested ( 6,735 ) 91.63  Forfeited ( 1,849 ) 83.35  Outstanding at December 31, 2021 14,890  $ 94.93  The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 718 million in 2021, $ 618 million in 2020 and $ 371 million in 2019. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, $ 592 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 5.31 in 2021, $ 4.84 in 2020 and $ 4.39 in 2019.

The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $ 670 million in 2021, 8 million shares for $ 757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $ 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. 2021 Form 10-K |  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2021, 2020 and 2019: (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post-employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ ( 830 ) $ ( 65 ) $ ( 1,722 ) $ ( 10 ) $ 147  $ ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 ) 95  ( 1,330 ) 12  298  ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 21 ) 87  ( 2 ) ( 157 ) ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 ) 74  ( 1,243 ) 10  141  ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 ( 928 ) 9  ( 2,965 )   288  ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 1,511  ( 785 ) ( 300 )   ( 108 ) 318  Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 14 ) 198    ( 23 ) 161  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 1,511  ( 799 ) ( 102 )   ( 131 ) 479  Balance as of December 31, 2020 583  ( 790 ) ( 3,067 )   157  ( 3,117 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 1,153 ) 720  298    76  ( 59 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 21 ) 223    75  277  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 1,153 ) 699  521    151  218  Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ ( 570 ) $ ( 91 ) $ ( 2,546 ) $   $ 308  $ ( 2,899 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2021 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 1.2 billion and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling gains of $ 699 million, which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2020 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of $ 1.5 billion and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling losses of $ 799 million, which were principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates.

The effective income tax rates in 2021, 2020 and 2019 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $ 1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The companys accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. The effective income tax rates for 2019 also included the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. |  2021 Form 10-K Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 937  $ 1,109  Accruals and reserves 667  438  Chargebacks and rebates 837  555  Advance payments 809  324  Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards 10,095  2,765  Other 1,234  1,371  Total deferred tax assets 14,579  6,562  Valuation allowances ( 9,391 ) ( 1,203 ) Total net deferred tax assets 5,188  5,359  Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 4,711 ) ( 5,274 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 308 ) ( 335 ) Other ( 904 ) ( 982 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 5,923 ) ( 6,591 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 735 ) $ ( 1,232 ) The decrease in net deferred tax assets is primarily related to the utilization of net operating losses and other carryforwards offset by an increase in advance payments. The decrease in deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to amortization of intangible assets. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, the company recorded adjustments within the measurement period in 2021 related to foreign net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The adjustments reflected an increase of $ 8.2 billion to deferred tax assets and an offsetting increase to valuation allowances, resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets. The company had valuation allowances of $ 9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2021, the company had U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards of $ 214 million as well as U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 34.4 billion, which will expire at various times through 2041. The remaining U.S. federal and foreign loss carryforwards of $ 3.2 billion have no expiration. The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings subject to the Acts transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. 2021 Form 10-K |  Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 5,264  $ 2,661  $ 2,852  Increase due to acquisition   2,674    Increase due to current year tax positions 208  91  113  Increase due to prior year tax positions 137  59  499  Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 62 ) ( 7 ) ( 21 ) Settlements ( 24 ) ( 141 ) ( 749 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 34 ) ( 73 ) ( 33 ) Ending balance $ 5,489  $ 5,264  $ 2,661  If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 5.2 billion in 2021 and $ 5.0 billion in 2020. Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2021, AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 79 million. The ""Increase due to current year tax positions"" and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. ""Increase due to acquisition"" in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 161 million in 2021, $ 142 million in 2020 and $ 51 million in 2019, for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $ 803 million at December 31, 2021, $ 642 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 191 million at December 31, 2019. The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 225 million. All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2008. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Antitrust Litigation Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits |  2021 Form 10-K pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorneys Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys fees. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. In May 2020, Perrigo Company and related entities filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that Abbott's 2011 AndroGel patent lawsuit filed against Perrigo was sham litigation. In October 2020, the Perrigo lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for New Jersey. In September 2021, the New Jersey court granted AbbVie's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the Perrigo lawsuit, dismissing it with prejudice. Perrigo has appealed the dismissal. Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVies settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVies Humira patent portfolio violated state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation . In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws.

The lawsuits, certified as a class action filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of Restasis, are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the MDL Rules as In re: Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2819. In May 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter that is subject to final court approval. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Government Proceedings Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately 3,130 matters are pending against Allergan. The federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation , MDL No. 2804. Approximately 251 of the claims are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these cases, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals, and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In December 2021, a California state court reached a judgment for Allergan and other defendants in the trial of an opioid lawsuit by Orange, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara Counties and the City of Oakland. In December 2021, Allergan reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit brought by the State of New York and two New York counties, which also provides all other New York counties and political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement. 2021 Form 10-K |  In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexicos Unfair Practices Act. In October 2020, the state added a claim under the New Mexico False Advertising Act. Shareholder and Securities Litigation In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three investment-fund plaintiffs, which they appealed. In March 2021, in the first of those appeals, the dismissal was affirmed. One of these plaintiffs refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending. In November 2020, the New York Supreme Court for the County of New York dismissed that lawsuit, which is being appealed. In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie's motion for summary judgment against all remaining plaintiffs on all the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals. In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants.

The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation . In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits, which received court approval in November 2021. Product Liability and General Litigation In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. Intellectual Property Litigation AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd are seeking to enforce their patent rights relating to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Humira). In April 2021 and May 2021, cases were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Alvotech hf. AbbVie alleges defendants proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In August 2021, the court denied Defendants motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds in the first case; a motion in the second case remains pending. The court has set a trial on a subset of patents for August 2022. The court order provides that Alvotech will stay off the market until that decision. Litigation on the remaining patents is stayed. In October 2021, the May 2021 declaratory judgment action filed by Alvotech hf. and its U.S. subsidiary Alvotech USA, Inc. in the United States Eastern District of Virginia was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois and subsequently dismissed. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd.. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires in 2036. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these suits. |  2021 Form 10-K Allergan USA, Inc., Allergan Sales, LLC, and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of AbbVie, are seeking to enforce patent rights relating to cariprazine (a drug sold under the trademark Vraylar). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2019 against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharma Global FZE; Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Limited. Allergan alleges defendants' proposed generic cariprazine products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Gedeon Richter Plc, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Allergan concerning the development and marketing of Vraylar, is the co-plaintiff in this suit. 2021 Form 10-K |  Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 2021 Form 10-K |  Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Revenue Recognition, the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 8,254 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of managements controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in managements calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Companys calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. |  2021 Form 10-K Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Business Combinations and in Note 11 under the caption Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures, the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 14,887 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, managements process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices.

Chicago, Illinois February 18, 2022 2021 Form 10-K |  "," ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Report of independent registered public accounting firm. The report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below. |  2021 Form 10-K Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 18, 2022 2021 Form 10-K |  "
1,abbv,20201231," ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview AbbVie (1) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the worlds most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other ArrangementsAcquisition of Allergan,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain. Segments AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, ""Segment and Geographic Area Information"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms ""AbbVie"" or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. |  2020 Form 10-K Products AbbVie's portfolio of products includes a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.

AbbVie's commercial rights to the sale and distribution of Synagis outside of the United States will revert to AstraZeneca upon the expiry of the current agreement in 2021. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AbbVie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. |  2020 Form 10-K In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. In 2020, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 38% of AbbVie's 2020 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVies competitors could cause revenues for AbbVies products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVies biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing such acts. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVies intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, 2020 Form 10-K |  the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a patent term restoration, for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDAs reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2021 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVies business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the companys business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the license in the United States will begin in 2023 and the license in Europe began in 2018. |  2020 Form 10-K In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVies employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs, and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other ArrangementsOther Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other ArrangementsOther Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Other than the Lupron near-term supply issue which has impacted availability of certain formulations, AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVies existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions. 2020 Form 10-K |  The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:  Phase 1involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing.  Phase 2tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients.  Phase 3tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses along with other labeling restrictions. |  2020 Form 10-K Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan and Russia) also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). RegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 2020 Form 10-K |  Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2021 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. |  2020 Form 10-K Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Regulation  Medical Devices Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVies medical device product candidates, including AbbVies breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale, and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market. United States . AbbVies medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVies medical device products, including AbbVies breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVies subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device. 2020 Form 10-K |  Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses along with other labeling restrictions. European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which will come into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformit Europenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVies ability to market and sell AbbVies products in these countries. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were approximately $6 million and operating expenditures were approximately $34 million. In 2021, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $9 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $36 million. Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 47,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2021. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Human Capital Management Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on peoples lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission. |  2020 Form 10-K Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVies continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access, and business development. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices. New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. AbbVie's mentorship program allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees career and development goals. AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities to all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, the foundation to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities. AbbVie also recently introduced additional development support to senior leaders who are managing increased integration and operational complexity following the transformational acquisition of Allergan. Culture. AbbVies shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion, and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development, and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes it culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVies mission of making a remarkable impact on peoples lives. Equity, Equality, Diversity  Inclusion (EEDI). A cornerstone of AbbVies human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. In 2019, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity  Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVies senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. Over the past year, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through June 2020, women represented 49 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 33 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2019. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie recently launched a new toolkit for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of EEDI to the business, educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior, and encourage participation in the company's inclusive culture learning opportunities. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community, hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities. In 2020, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by appointing two additional senior level positions to drive change and awareness company-wide and taking deliberate steps to ensure AbbVie leads by example in promoting racial equity, as further described on the company's website at: https://www.abbvie.com/our-company/our-principles/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html. 2020 Form 10-K |  COVID-19 Health and Safety. AbbVie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to drive strong business performance. AbbVie also implemented, among other things, temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures; regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on AbbVie's business and employees; establishment of physical distancing procedures, modification of workspaces, and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees; temperature screening at all company locations; a variety of testing resources including on-site and at-home testing and COVID case management programs; and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees needs for flexibility. In addition, COVID-19 is a covered event under the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund's Employee Relief Program, entitling eligible AbbVie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance. AbbVie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the company's employees with relevant medical, pharmaceutical, RD, science, public health and public safety skills, knowledge, training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic. Lastly, AbbVies commitment to employees was evidenced by no workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with COVID-19 . Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). "," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVies operations and financial condition. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVies operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVies employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVies employees, patients, customers and business partners. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVies operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to-date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower |  2020 Form 10-K new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVies operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, the outbreak could have a material adverse impact on AbbVies operations and financial condition. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessIntellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings."" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.8 billion in 2020, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful 2020 Form 10-K |  claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. Humira accounted for approximately 43% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in  The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVies future revenues and operating earnings  above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. |  2020 Form 10-K Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding Humiracould adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVies biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVies biologic products, AbbVies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVies products, and this could negatively impact AbbVies business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. 2020 Form 10-K |  AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Certain aspects of AbbVies operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVies oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVies operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVies newly acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergans textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVies business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,100 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain |  2020 Form 10-K relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, ""Legal Proceedings and Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development, BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing, and BusinessRegulationMedical Devices. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 2020 Form 10-K |  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 24% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  international trade disruptions or disputes;  difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic;  sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  restrictions on transfers of funds;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. |  2020 Form 10-K If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2020, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. In particular, AbbVie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of Allergan. AbbVies substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie 2020 Form 10-K |  raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others have resulted, and may in the future result, in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, AbbVies business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVies or third-party providers databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVies balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, have increased significantly. Such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. A significant amount of AbbVies total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of AbbVies developed product rights and other intangible assets was $82.9 billion and the carrying value of AbbVies goodwill was $33.1 billion. AbbVies developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. AbbVies other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and AbbVies IPRD intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPRD impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVies results of operations and financial condition. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVies ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVies success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (RD), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; |  2020 Form 10-K  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;  environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVies manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials;  changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and  changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; 2020 Form 10-K |   a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. |  2020 Form 10-K CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 47,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2020 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2020 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $45.8 billion, operating earnings of $11.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.72 and cash flows from operations of $17.6 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 38% on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis, which included $10.3 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Imbruvica and Venclexta. Diluted earnings per share in 2020 was $2.72 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $5.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $4.8 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) $3.0 billion of Allergan acquisition and integration expenses; (iv) $1.2 billion for acquired in-process research and development (IPRD); and $241 million for milestones and other research and development (RD) expenses. These costs were partially offset by $1.7 billion of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVies pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVies on-market brands. In October 2020, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock payable in February 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50% realized in RD, 40% in selling, general and administrative (SGA) and 10% in cost of products sold. 2020 Form 10-K |  To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, AbbVie announced that it entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver food and essential supplies during the crisis. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain. 2021 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:  Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and expanding patient access of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth.  Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both Imbruvica and Venclexta.  Expansion of the companys revenue base from additional Allergan products contributing to key aesthetics and neuroscience portfolios.  Effective management of Humira international biosimilar erosion.  Optimization of combined AbbVie and Allergan research and development, commercial, and manufacturing operations while maintaining key growth portfolios.  The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2021. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. |  2020 Form 10-K Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Skyrizi  In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical trials of Skyrizi in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.  In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE induction studies of Skyrizi in patients with Crohns Disease met the primary and key secondary endpoints. Rinvoq  In February 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial of Rinvoq in adult patients with active PsA. Results from the SELECT-PsA 1 study, which evaluated Rinvoq versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), showed that both doses of Rinvoq met the primary and key secondary endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.  In May 2020, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, in June 2020, submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA.  In June 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 Measure Up 1 study and, in July 2020, announced top-line results from its Phase 3 Measure Up 2 and AD Up studies of Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) met all primary and secondary endpoints versus placebo.  In August 2020, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA and, earlier this year, submitted an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).  In October 2020, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe AD.  In December 2020, AbbVie announced its Phase 3 U-ACHIEVE induction study of Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.  In January 2021, AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active PsA and active AS. 2020 Form 10-K |  Oncology Imbruvica  In April 2020, AbbVie received FDA approval for the use of Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  In August 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for Imbruvica in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL. Venclexta  In February 2020, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 VIALE-C trial of Venclexta in combination with low-dose cytarabine in newly-diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) did not meet its primary endpoint.  In March 2020, AbbVie announced that top-line results from its Phase 3 VIALE-A trial of Venclexta in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML met its primary endpoints.  In March 2020, AbbVie received EC approval of Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with previously untreated CLL.  In June 2020, AbbVie submitted an MAA to the EMA for Venclyxto for the treatment of patients with AML.  In October 2020, AbbVie received FDA full approval of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with AML. The approval is supported by data from a series of trials including the Phase 3 VIALE-A and VIALE-C studies. Aesthetics Juvederm Collection  In June 2020, AbbVie received FDA approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for the augmentation of the chin region to improve the chin profile in adults over the age of 21. Neuroscience Botox Therapeutic  In June 2020, the FDA accepted the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the Botox prescribing information for the treatment of detrusor (bladder muscle) overactivity associated with an underlying neurologic condition in certain pediatric patients. In February 2021, AbbVie received FDA approval of Botox for the treatment of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition in certain pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.  In July 2020, AbbVie received FDA approval of Botox for the treatment of lower limb spasticity caused by cerebral palsy in pediatric patients over the age of 2. Atogepant  In July 2020, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial evaluating atogepant, an orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, for migraine prevention met its primary endpoint for all doses (10mg, 30mg, and 60mg) compared to placebo, all secondary endpoints with 30mg and 60mg doses, and four out of six secondary endpoints with the 10mg dose.  In January 2021, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. Elezanumab  In September 2020, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for elezanumab, an investigational treatment for patients following spinal cord injury. |  2020 Form 10-K Virology/Liver Disease Mavyret  In March 2020, AbbVie announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Maviret to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-nave, compensated cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with genotype 3 infection. Eye Care AGN-190584  In October 2020, AbbVie announced that top-line results from its Phase 3 GEMINI 1 and 2 studies of AGN-190584, an investigational ophthalmic solution, for the treatment of presbyopia met their primary endpoint and majority of the secondary endpoints. Abicipar pegol  In June 2020, AbbVie announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to the Biologics License Application (BLA) for abicipar pegol, a novel, investigational DARPin therapy for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed following administration of abicipar pegol results in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio in the treatment of nAMD. In July 2020, AbbVie withdrew the regulatory application with the EMA for abicipar pegol for the treatment of nAMD. Women's Health Oriahnn  In May 2020, the FDA approved Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis. Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2020 driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 12% in 2020 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Biosimilar competition for Humira is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to maintain market leadership among its installed patient base and add to the sustainability of Humira. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth and market share gains over the prior year following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by the August 2019 FDA approval and December 2019 EC approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. 2020 Form 10-K |  Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 14% in 2020 as a result of continued penetration of Imbruvica for patients with CLL, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Net revenues for Venclexta increased 69% in 2020 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML. Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics were $1.1 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics were $718 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas were $1.4 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression were $951 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Global Mavyret sales decreased 37% in 2020 primarily driven by lower global new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as competitive dynamics in the U.S. Net revenues for Creon increased 7% in 2020 primarily driven by continued market growth, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market with approximately 80% total market share. Net revenues for Lupron decreased 14% in 2020 primarily due to a near-term supply issue which has impacted product availability of certain formulations. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Gross margin $ 30,417 $ 25,827 $ 25,035 18 % 3 % as a percent of net revenues 66 % 78 % 76 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value step-up adjustments associated with the Allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for Imbruvica and Venclexta. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 11,299 $ 6,942 $ 7,399 63 % (6) % as a percent of net revenues 25 % 21 % 23 % Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 increased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of incremental SGA expenses of Allergan, including transaction and integration costs resulting from the acquisition. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Research and development $ 6,557 $ 6,407 $ 10,329 2 % (38) % as a percent of net revenues 14 % 19 % 32 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 1,198 $ 385 $ 424 100% (9) % Research and Development (RD) expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2020 primarily due to the $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge in 2019, which represented the remaining value of the IPRD acquired as part |  2020 Form 10-K of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to terminate the Rova-T RD program. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. RD expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 were also favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Acquired IPRD expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPRD expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S (Genmab) to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPRD expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Genmab and I-Mab agreements. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019. Other Operating Expenses and Income Other operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 2,454 $ 1,784 $ 1,348 Interest income (174) (275) (204) Interest expense, net $ 2,280 $ 1,509 $ 1,144 Net foreign exchange loss $ 71 $ 42 $ 24 Other expense, net 5,614 3,006 18 Interest expense in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with the financing of the Allergan acquisition as well as the incremental Allergan debt acquired, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the companys debt obligations. Interest income in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $5.8 billion in 2020 and $3.1 billion in 2019. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates. In 2019, the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T RD program. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was negative 36% in 2020, 6% in 2019 and negative 9% in 2018. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, the cost of repatriation decisions, tax audit settlements and Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. 2020 Form 10-K |  FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Cash flows from: Operating activities $ 17,588 $ 13,324 $ 13,427 Investing activities (37,557) 596 (1,006) Financing activities (11,501) 18,708 (14,396) Operating cash flows in 2020 increased from 2019 and included the results of Allergan subsequent to the May 8 acquisition date. Operating cash flows in 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows, partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVies contributions to its defined benefit plans of $367 million in 2020 and $727 million in 2019. Investing cash flows in 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion. Investing cash flows also included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million. Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million. Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity, and the November 2020 repayments of 700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate Allergan exchange notes at maturity and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Allergan exchange notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Cash dividend payments totaled $7.7 billion in 2020 and $6.4 billion in 2019. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020 as well as an increase in the dividend rate. On October 30, 2020, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 16, 2021 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020 and 2019, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an |  2020 Form 10-K allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2020, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings Following the acquisition of Allergan, SP Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the companys ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the companys outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Short-term borrowings $ 34 $ 34 $  $  $  Long-term debt, including current portion 84,948 8,422 16,643 16,197 43,686 Interest on long-term debt (a) 33,664 2,752 4,652 3,898 22,362 Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments 1,154 229 323 208 394 Purchase obligations and other (b) 5,432 5,040 249 112 31 Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) 18,478 1,029 3,036 4,144 10,269 Total $ 143,710 $ 17,506 $ 24,903 $ 24,559 $ 76,742 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2020. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. 2020 Form 10-K |  (d) Includes $13.0 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (e) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. AbbVie enters into RD collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $27.0 billion in 2020, $18.8 billion in 2019 and $16.4 billion in 2018. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. |  2020 Form 10-K The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 89% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2020. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.

Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2021 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (89) $ 101 Projected benefit obligation (1,000) 1,140 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (6) $ 7 Projected benefit obligation (56) 63 2020 Form 10-K |  The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2021 by $94 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPRD acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPRD acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. |  2020 Form 10-K For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.1% - 2.2% 1.1% Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 56% - 92% 64% Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56% - 100% 91% Projected year of payments 2021 - 2034 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excludes early stage indications with 0% estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100% probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56% to 89% at December 31, 2020.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019: 2020 2019 as of December 31 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 7,818 1.213 $ (39) $ 6,217 1.116 $ (12) Japanese yen 837 103.9 (7) 820 108.7  Canadian dollar 591 1.328 (23) 504 1.324 (6) British pound 275 1.341 3 427 1.305 (6) All other currencies 1,706 n/a (15) 1,508 n/a (10) Total $ 11,227 $ (81) $ 9,476 $ (34) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.14 billion at December 31, 2020. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2020, the company has  6.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $111 million at December 31, 2020. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. |  2020 Form 10-K "," ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. 2020 Form 10-K |  For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (RD) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 1.8 billion in 2020, $ 1.1 billion in 2019 and $ 1.1 billion in 2018. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in |  2020 Form 10-K equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Finished goods $ 1,318  $ 485  Work-in-process 1,201  942  Raw materials 791  386  Inventories $ 3,310  $ 1,813  Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Land $ 288  $ 72  Buildings 2,555  1,613  Equipment 6,976  6,012  Construction in progress 1,040  491  Property and equipment, gross 10,859  8,188  Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,611 ) ( 5,226 ) Property and equipment, net $ 5,248  $ 2,962  Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 666 million in 2020, $ 464 million in 2019 and $ 471 million in 2018. Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not 2020 Form 10-K |  readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPRD projects acquired are expensed as IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to |  2020 Form 10-K regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPRD projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. RD costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption of the standard, accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses was $ 262 million at December 31, 2020. There were no significant changes in credit loss risk factors that impacted the company's recorded allowance during 2020. 2020 Form 10-K |  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021. AbbVie has completed its assessment of the new standard and concluded that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 2,454  $ 1,784  $ 1,348  Interest income ( 174 ) ( 275 ) ( 204 ) Interest expense, net $ 2,280  $ 1,509  $ 1,144  Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Sales rebates $ 7,188  $ 4,484  Dividends payable 2,335  1,771  Accounts payable 2,276  1,452  Salaries, wages and commissions 1,669  830  Royalty and license arrangements 483  324  Other 6,208  2,971  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 20,159  $ 11,832  Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 12,289  $ 7,201  Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 5,680  2,772  Income taxes payable 3,847  3,453  Pension and other post-employment benefits 3,413  2,949  Other 2,378  1,222  Other long-term liabilities $ 27,607  $ 17,597  |  2020 Form 10-K Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Basic EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 4,616  $ 7,882  $ 5,687  Earnings allocated to participating securities 60  40  30  Earnings available to common shareholders $ 4,556  $ 7,842  $ 5,657  Weighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding 1,667  1,481  1,541  Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 2.73  $ 5.30  $ 3.67  Diluted EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 4,616  $ 7,882  $ 5,687  Earnings allocated to participating securities 60  40  30  Earnings available to common shareholders $ 4,556  $ 7,842  $ 5,657  Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,667  1,481  1,541  Effect of dilutive securities 6  3  5  Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding 1,673  1,484  1,546  Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 2.72  $ 5.28  $ 3.66  Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of Allergan On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $ 120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows: (in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a) $ 39,675  Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b) 23,979  Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c) 430  Total consideration $ 64,084  (a) Represents cash consideration transferred of $ 120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing. 2020 Form 10-K |  (b) Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $ 83.96 per share. (c) Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders. The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2020. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the company made certain measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation, including: (i) an increase to developed product rights intangible assets of $ 9.1 billion; (ii) an increase to IPRD intangible assets of $ 710 million; (iii) an increase to property and equipment of $ 215 million; (iv) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $ 73 million; and (v) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $ 10.0 billion. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from revised future cash flow estimates for certain intangible assets and completing valuations of property and equipment. These measurement period adjustments have been reflected in the table below. The company made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents $ 1,537  Short-term investments 1,421  Accounts receivable 2,374  Inventories 2,340  Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,982  Investments 137  Property and equipment 2,127  Intangible assets Developed product rights 67,330  In-process research and development 1,750  Other noncurrent assets 1,395  Short-term borrowings ( 60 ) Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 1,899 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 5,852 ) Long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 18,937 ) Deferred income taxes ( 3,792 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 4,765 ) Total identifiable net assets 47,088  Goodwill 16,996  Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 64,084  The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $ 1.2 billion is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date. Intangible assets relate to $ 67.3 billion of developed product rights and $ 1.8 billion of IPRD. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market |  2020 Form 10-K participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $ 1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $ 10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $ 1.1 billion, inclusive of $ 4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and $ 1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $ 781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $ 103 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which were included in SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Net revenues $ 50,521  $ 49,028  Net earnings (loss) 6,746  ( 38 ) The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.4 billion in 2020, $ 1.1 billion in 2019 and $ 736 million in 2018. AbbVie recorded acquired IPRD charges of $ 1.2 billion in 2020, $ 385 million in 2019 and $ 424 million in 2018. Significant arrangements impacting 2020, 2019 and 2018, some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. Luminera In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and RD pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $ 186 million was comprised of a $ 122 million upfront cash payment and $ 64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. HArmonyCa is currently commercially available in Israel and Brazil and AbbVie will continue to develop this product for its international and U.S. markets. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the 2020 Form 10-K |  acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $ 33 million of intangible assets for developed product rights. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. I-Mab Biopharma In September 2020, AbbVie and I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) entered into a collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody internally discovered and developed by I-Mab for the treatment of multiple cancers. Both companies will collaborate to design and conduct further global clinical trials to evaluate lemzoparlimab. The collaboration provides AbbVie an exclusive global license, excluding greater China, to develop and commercialize lemzoparlimab. The companies will share manufacturing responsibilities with AbbVie being the primary manufacturer for global supply. The agreement also allows for potential collaboration on future CD47-related therapeutic agents, subject to further licenses to explore each other's related programs in their respective territories. The terms of the arrangement include an initial upfront payment of $ 180 million to exclusively license lemzoparlimab along with a milestone payment of $ 20 million based on the Phase I results, for a total of $ 200 million, which was recorded to IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2020 after regulatory approval of the transaction. In addition, I-Mab will be eligible to receive up to $ 1.7 billion upon the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and AbbVie will pay tiered royalties from low-to-mid teen percentages on global net revenues outside of greater China.

The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. |  2020 Form 10-K Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 5.8 billion in 2020, $ 1.6 billion in 2019 and $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: (in billions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 7.7  $ 7.2  $ 7.5  $ 8.0  $ 8.4  No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPRD associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The increase in indefinite-lived research and development assets during 2020 was due to the acquisition of Allergan in the second quarter of 2020 and the acquisition of Luminera in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding these acquisitions. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist.

This termination was subsequent to the decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, which resulted in an impairment charge of $ 5.1 billion in 2018. These impairment charges were recorded to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019 and 2018. Note 8 Integration and Restructuring Plans Allergan Integration Plan Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization.

AbbVie has outstanding $ 7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2016 and $ 10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2015. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes, at any time, prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium and AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. AbbVie has outstanding $ 5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2012. AbbVie may redeem all of the senior notes of each series, at any time, or some of the senior notes of each series, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. At December 31, 2020, the company was in compliance with its senior note covenants and term loan covenants. Short-Term Borrowings There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 1.8 % in 2020, 2.5 % in 2019 and 2.0 % in 2018. In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $ 4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2020. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2020, 2019 and 2018. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In March 2019, AbbVie repaid a $ 3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was drawn on in June 2018 and was scheduled to mature in June 2019. |  2020 Form 10-K Maturities of Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes AbbVie's debt maturities as of December 31, 2020: as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) 2021 $ 8,422  2022 12,428  2023 4,215  2024 7,426  2025 8,771  Thereafter 43,686  Total obligations and commitments 84,948  Fair value hedges, unamortized bond premiums and discounts, deferred financing costs and finance lease obligations 1,074  Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations $ 86,022  Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2020 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 2020 Form 10-K |  and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of  6.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and  3.6 billion at December 31, 2019. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling  971 million at December 31, 2020 and  971 million,  204 million, and CHF 62 million at December 31, 2019. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 4.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 10.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones |  2020 Form 10-K and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.1 % - 2.2 % 1.1 % Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 56 % - 92 % 64 % Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56 % - 100 % 91 % Projected year of payments 2021 - 2034 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excludes early stage indications with 0 % estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100 % probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2020. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 7,340  $ 4,483  $ 4,534  Additions (a) 225      Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 5,753  3,091  49  Payments ( 321 ) ( 234 ) ( 100 ) Ending balance $ 12,997  $ 7,340  $ 4,483  (a) Additions during the year ended December 31, 2020 represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the Allergan acquisition as well as contingent consideration resulting from the Luminera acquisition. The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recorded a $ 4.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T RD program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $ 428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval. 2020 Form 10-K |  Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The carrying amount of these investments was $ 102 million as of December 31, 2020 and $ 66 million as of December 31, 2019. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of December 31, 2020. Concentrations of Risk Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 72 % as of December 31, 2020 and 68 % as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 43 % of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020, 58 % in 2019 and 61 % in 2018. |  2020 Form 10-K Note 12 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.

The 2019 actuarial losses of $ 1.7 billion for qualified pension plans and $ 451 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2018. A change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $ 397 million.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % for 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. 2020 Form 10-K |  Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 1,143  $ 1,143  $   $   U.S. mid cap (b) 164  164      International (c) 524  524      Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 132  18  114    Corporate debt instruments (d) 854  178  676    Non-U.S. government securities (d) 544  397  147    Other (d) 297  294  3    Absolute return funds (e) 310  4  306    Real assets 10  10      Other (f) 252  250  2    Total $ 4,230  $ 2,982  $ 1,248  $   Total assets measured at NAV 5,472  Fair value of plan assets $ 9,702  Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 884  $ 884  $   $   U.S. mid cap (b) 138  138      International (c) 349  349      Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 149  21  128    Corporate debt instruments (d) 372  112  260    Non-U.S. government securities (d) 202  84  118    Other (d) 320  318  2    Absolute return funds (e) 296  4  292    Real assets 9  9      Other (f) 132  132      Total $ 2,851  $ 2,051  $ 800  $   Total assets measured at NAV 4,265  Fair value of plan assets $ 7,116  (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2020 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 50 % in equity securities, 20 % in fixed income securities and 30 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2021 $ 284  $ 23  2022 301  29  2023 319  31  2024 339  33  2025 362  36  2026 to 2030 2,169  217  Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plans are the AbbVie Savings Plan and the Allergan Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $ 191 million in 2020, $ 102 million in 2019 and $ 89 million in 2018 related to these plans. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for 2020 Form 10-K |  stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Cost of products sold $ 47  $ 29  $ 27  Research and development 247  171  169  Selling, general and administrative 459  230  225  Pre-tax compensation expense 753  430  421  Tax benefit 131  80  73  After-tax compensation expense $ 622  $ 350  $ 348  Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 34 million in 2020, $ 15 million in 2019 and $ 78 million in 2018. Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 12.14 in 2020, $ 12.54 in 2019 and $ 21.63 in 2018. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2020: (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6,761  $ 60.39  5.9 $ 207  Granted 1,995  93.50  Granted in acquisition 11,152  70.48  Exercised ( 4,129 ) 51.29  Lapsed ( 88 ) 107.33  Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,691  $ 73.90  4.7 $ 559  Exercisable at December 31, 2020 12,440  $ 69.99  3.6 $ 498  The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 186 million in 2020, $ 22 million in 2019 and $ 215 million in 2018. The total fair value of options vested during 2020 was $ 292 million. As of December 31, 2020, $ 13 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period. For awards granted in 2020, performance is based on AbbVie's return on invested capital (ROIC) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. For awards granted in 2018 and 2019, the tranches tied to 2020 performance are based on AbbVies return on equity (ROE) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest |  2020 Form 10-K over a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVies EPS achievement and AbbVies total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVies common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2020: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 10,232  $ 81.72  Granted 5,524  92.35  Granted in acquisition 8,234  83.96  Vested ( 6,667 ) 80.09  Forfeited ( 1,405 ) 84.13  Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,918  $ 87.03  The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 618 million in 2020, $ 371 million in 2019 and $ 583 million in 2018. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, $ 579 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 4.84 in 2020, $ 4.39 in 2019 and $ 3.95 in 2018. The following table summarizes quarterly cash dividends declared during 2020, 2019 and 2018: 2020 2019 2018 Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share 10/30/20 02/16/21 $ 1.30 11/01/19 02/14/20 $ 1.18 11/02/18 02/15/19 $ 1.07 09/11/20 11/16/20 $ 1.18 09/06/19 11/15/19 $ 1.07 09/07/18 11/15/18 $ 0.96 06/17/20 08/14/20 $ 1.18 06/20/19 08/15/19 $ 1.07 06/14/18 08/15/18 $ 0.96 02/20/20 05/15/20 $ 1.18 02/21/19 05/15/19 $ 1.07 02/15/18 05/15/18 $ 0.96 Stock Repurchase Program The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $ 757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $ 5.0 billion increase to the existing $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $ 10.7 billion in 2018. Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $ 1.3 billion in 2018. 2020 Form 10-K |  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2020, 2019 and 2018: (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post-employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ ( 439 ) $ ( 203 ) $ ( 1,919 ) $   $ ( 166 ) $ ( 2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 391 ) 138  84  ( 14 ) 156  ( 27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss     113  4  157  274  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 391 ) 138  197  ( 10 ) 313  247  Balance as of December 31, 2018 ( 830 ) ( 65 ) ( 1,722 ) ( 10 ) 147  ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 ) 95  ( 1,330 ) 12  298  ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 21 ) 87  ( 2 ) ( 157 ) ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 ) 74  ( 1,243 ) 10  141  ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 ( 928 ) 9  ( 2,965 )   288  ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 1,511  ( 785 ) ( 300 )   ( 108 ) 318  Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 14 ) 198    ( 23 ) 161  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 1,511  ( 799 ) ( 102 )   ( 131 ) 479  Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 583  $ ( 790 ) $ ( 3,067 ) $   $ 157  $ ( 3,117 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of $ 1.5 billion in 2020 which were principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 98 million in 2019 and $ 391 million in 2018 which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates.

The effective income tax rates in 2020, 2019 and 2018 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, the cost of repatriation decisions, tax audit settlements and Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $ 1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2020, 2019 and 2018 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The companys accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. In 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. For 2019, the impact of the Act affected the full year earnings of these subsidiaries, resulting in additional tax expense compared to the previous year. The effective income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 also included the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. |  2020 Form 10-K Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 1,109  $ 810  Accruals and reserves 438  371  Chargebacks and rebates 555  477  Advance payments 324  615  Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards 2,765  838  Other 1,371  406  Total deferred tax assets 6,562  3,517  Valuation allowances ( 1,203 ) ( 731 ) Total net deferred tax assets 5,359  2,786  Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 5,274 ) ( 2,712 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 335 ) ( 249 ) Other ( 982 ) ( 440 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 6,591 ) ( 3,401 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,232 ) $ ( 615 ) The increases in deferred tax liabilities are primarily due to the acquisition of Allergan in which the company recorded the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets. The increases in deferred tax assets are primarily due to deferred tax asset recognition related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, the company had U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards of $ 293 million as well as U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 4.3 billion, which will expire at various times through 2040. The remaining U.S. federal and non-U.S. loss carryforwards of $ 5.8 billion have no expiration. The company had valuation allowances of $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 731 million as of December 31, 2019. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Acts transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine.

AbbVie will 2020 Form 10-K |  be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 5.0 billion in 2020 and $ 2.4 billion in 2019. Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2020, AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 81 million. The ""Increase due to current year tax positions"" and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. ""Increase due to acquisition"" in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 142 million in 2020, $ 51 million in 2019 and $ 73 million in 2018, for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $ 642 million at December 31, 2020, $ 191 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 190 million at December 31, 2018. The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 68 million. All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2008. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $ 60 million as of December 31, 2020 and approximately $ 290 million as of December 31, 2019. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. In addition, other operating income in 2019 included $ 550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Antitrust Litigation Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020, the court denied the end-payers' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorneys Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys fees. |  2020 Form 10-K In September 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTCs settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $ 448 million, plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTCs request for injunctive relief. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district courts finding of sham litigation with respect to one generic company and affirmed with respect to the other but held the FTC lacked authority to obtain a disgorgement remedy and vacated the district courts award. The Third Circuit also affirmed the district courts denial of the FTCs injunction request and reinstated the FTCs settlement-related claim for further proceedings in the district court. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

AbbVie Inc., et al ., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In February 2020, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Elfers v. Gonzalez, et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties regarding alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value and in connection with the announcements of results of AbbVies 2018 Dutch auction tender offer.

The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation . The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2020, the court denied plaintiffs class certification motion because it found the lead plaintiff to be an inadequate representative of the proposed class but allowed another putative class member to propose itself as a new lead plaintiff. In December 2020, the court appointed a new lead plaintiff. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergans former Actavis generics unit and its alleged anticompetitive conduct with other generic drug companies. The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation .

Allergan Inc., et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. Intellectual Property Litigation Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib capsules (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). In February 2018 a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Sandoz Inc. and Lek Pharmaceuticals D.D. In the case, Pharmacyclics alleges the defendants' proposed generic ibrutinib product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 2020 Form 10-K |  Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Revenue Recognition, the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $7,188 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of managements controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in managements calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Companys calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Business Combinations and in Note 11 under the caption Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures, the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $12,997 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. |  2020 Form 10-K How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, managements process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted managements conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Companys Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. Accounting for Allergan plc acquisition  Valuation of intangible assets Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements, the Company completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan) on May 8, 2020 for approximately $64,084 million. The Company measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of $69,080 million of intangible assets, comprised of $67,330 million of developed product rights and $1,750 million of in-process research and development (IPRD). Auditing the valuation of intangible assets was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of the identified intangible assets. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to managements forecasts of net revenues, including growth rates used to estimate future net cash flows for acquired aesthetics and recently launched products. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys accounting for acquisitions including, among others, managements process to establish the significant assumptions used in determining the fair values of intangible assets. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of estimated future net revenues, the determination of future net cash flows, estimated growth rates, and review of the valuation model. To test the estimated fair value of intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, evaluating the valuation methods used, and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources, and historical product trends, including those of comparable products, to the extent applicable. Estimated future net revenues were evaluated for reasonableness against internal and external analyses, including analyst expectations, industry trends, and market trends. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted managements conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the valuation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. 2020 Form 10-K |  Accounting for Allergan plc acquisition  Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 14 under the caption Income Taxes, as part of the acquisition of Allergan plc, the Company recorded $2,674 million of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions. The Company applied judgment in evaluating the completeness of unrecognized tax benefits assumed as of the acquisition date. Some of the more significant judgments inherent in the Companys evaluation of assumed uncertain tax positions included whether a tax positions technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained, including consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. Auditing the Companys analysis and accounting for uncertain tax positions was complex due to the interpretation of tax laws and legal rulings in multiple tax paying jurisdictions and required significant judgment in determining whether an assumed tax positions technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained. In particular, each assumed unrecognized tax benefit involved unique facts and circumstances and multiple potential outcomes that were evaluated, with many uncertainties around initial recognition, including regulatory changes, litigation and examination activity. Management utilized outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, in its evaluation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys accounting for acquisitions including, among others, managements process to evaluate the completeness and estimation of unrecognized tax benefits. This included testing controls over managements determination of whether an assumed tax positions technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained and, if so, recognizing the estimated amount of qualified tax benefit. We also obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant fair value assumptions and unrecognized tax benefits was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the completeness and recognition of unrecognized tax benefits, our audit procedures included, among others, testing managements process for estimating the unrecognized tax benefits. Testing managements process included assessing managements interpretation of the unique facts, circumstances and related tax laws and legal rulings in each tax paying jurisdiction, examining whether the technical merits of each tax position were more-likely-than-not to be sustained, and evaluating the recognition of the amount of qualified tax benefit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and recognition of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits, including consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 |  2020 Form 10-K "," ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Report of independent registered public accounting firm. The report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below. 2020 Form 10-K |  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 |  2020 Form 10-K "

HUMIRA is sold in numerous other markets worldwide, including Japan, China, Brazil and Australia, and accounted for approximately 58% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . SKYRIZI. SKYRIZI (risankizumab) is an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. It is a biologic therapy administered as a quarterly subcutaneous injection following an induction dose. SKYRIZI is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In Japan, SKYRIZI is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have an inadequate response to conventional therapies. RINVOQ . RINVOQ (upadacitinib) is a once-daily oral selective and reversible JAK inhibitor and is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union. RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. Oncology products. AbbVies oncology products target some of the most complex and difficult-to-treat cancers. These products are: IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is an oral, once-daily therapy that inhibits a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval after being granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is one of the few therapies to receive four separate designations. IMBRUVICA currently is approved for the treatment of adult patients with:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL/SLL with 17p deletion;  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy*;  Waldenstrms macroglobulinemia (WM);  Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy*; and  Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. _______________________________________________________________________________ * Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) is a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat hematological malignancies. VENCLEXTA is approved by the FDA for adults with CLL or SLL.

VENCLYXTO is approved in Europe for CLL in combination with rituximab in patients who have received at least one previous treatment. Virology Products. AbbVie's virology products address unmet needs for patients living with HCV and HIV. HCV products. AbbVie's HCV products are: MAVYRET/MAVIRET. MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (MAVIRET) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and following the EXPEDITION-8 study, also in patients with compensated cirrhosis who are new to treatment. MAVIRET is now also indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1-6 in children between 12-18 years. VIEKIRA PAK AND TECHNIVIE. VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) is an all-oral, short-course, interferon-free therapy, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, including those with compensated cirrhosis. In Europe, VIEKIRA PAK is marketed as VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA and is approved for use in patients with genotype 1 and genotype 4 HCV. AbbVie's TECHNIVIE (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and 2    |  2019 Form 10-K   ritonavir) is FDA-approved for use in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of adults with genotype 4 HCV infection in the United States. The use of VIEKIRA in the United States, Europe and Japan is currently limited given the significant use of pangenotypic regimens, including MAVIRET. Additional Virology products. AbbVie's additional virology products include: SYNAGIS. SYNAGIS (palivizumab) is a product marketed by AbbVie outside of the United States that protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). KALETRA.

ORILISSA (elagolix) is the first and only orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. The FDA approved ORILISSA under priority review. It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. ORILISSA inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Outside the United States, ORILISSA is also launched in Canada and Puerto Rico. Duopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa). AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States. Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane (sold under the trademarks Ultane and Sevorane) is an anesthesia product that AbbVie sells worldwide for human use. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States all of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and country regulatory bodies. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors.   2019 Form 10-K  |   3 In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. In 2019 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42% of AbbVie's 2019 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. These wholesalers purchase product from AbbVie under standard terms and conditions of sale. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with other available HCV treatment options. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVies competitors could cause revenues for AbbVies products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVies biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. HUMIRA is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the Public Health Service Act, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVies intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a patent term restoration, for 4    |  2019 Form 10-K   patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDAs reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2020 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVies business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark HUMIRA), are material in relation to the companys business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the license in the United States will begin in 2023 and the license in Europe began in 2018. In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark IMBRUVICA) and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (which are sold under the trademarks MAVYRET and MAVIRET). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently   2019 Form 10-K  |   5 discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVies employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs, and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements  Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity ,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements  Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity ,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVies existing portfolio. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:  Phase 1involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing.  Phase 2tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients.  Phase 3tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. 6    |  2019 Form 10-K   The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA or BLA and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). RegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory   2019 Form 10-K  |   7 procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and 8    |  2019 Form 10-K   teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2020 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2019 were approximately $29 million and operating expenditures were approximately $34 million . In 2020 , capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $5 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $35 million . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.   2019 Form 10-K  |   9 Employees AbbVie employed approximately 30,000 persons as of January 31, 2020 . Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). "," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to AbbVie's business, risks related to AbbVie's proposed acquisition of Allergan (the ""Acquisition"") and the combined company upon completion of the Acquisition, and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1 , "" Business Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3 , "" Legal Proceedings ."" The United States composition of matter patent for HUMIRA, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.2 billion in 2019 , expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. 10    |  2019 Form 10-K   AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.  A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.  Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. HUMIRA accounted for approximately 58% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for HUMIRA (as described further in  The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVies future revenues and operating earnings  above), the commercialization of biosimilars of HUMIRA, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of HUMIRA for any reason.  AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process,   2019 Form 10-K  |   11 including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.  A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.  Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding HUMIRAcould adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.  AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVies biologic products, including HUMIRA. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVies biologic products, AbbVies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant 12    |  2019 Form 10-K   exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products.  New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVies virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVies products, and this could negatively impact AbbVies business and results of operations.  The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.  AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier.  Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken   2019 Form 10-K  |   13 by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products.  AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVies business and results of operations.  AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.  14    |  2019 Form 10-K   AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1 , "" Business RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development."" The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 28% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  international trade disruptions or disputes, including in connection with the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China;  difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;   2019 Form 10-K  |   15  political and economic instability, including the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union;  sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability.  If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.  AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions (such as the pending acquisition of Allergan), technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.  AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2019 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. 16    |  2019 Form 10-K   AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt.  AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business.  AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVies or third-party providers databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVies ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVies success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical RD, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;   2019 Form 10-K  |   17  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and  changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups.  Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Combined Company Upon Completion of the Acquisition The pending acquisition of Allergan may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits. Consummation of the Acquisition is conditioned on, among other things, obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals. If any of the conditions to the Acquisition is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the Acquisition from occurring, which could negatively impact AbbVies share price and future business and financial results. Further, as a condition to their approval of the Acquisition, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the AbbVies business after the closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the Acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, including Irish legislation implementing a tax increase payable upon completion of the Acquisition, could adversely impact AbbVies post-Acquisition profitability and financial results. Following the Acquisition, AbbVie may not realize the Acquisitions intended benefits within the expected timeframe or at all.  The indebtedness of the combined company following the consummation of the Acquisition will be substantially greater than AbbVies indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of AbbVie and Allergan prior to the announcement of the acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined companys business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs. AbbVie expects that the cash consideration due to Allergans shareholders under the transaction agreement and related fees and expenses will be approximately $41 billion. In addition to using cash on hand, AbbVie has incurred significant Acquisition-related debt financing, including unsecured term loans and senior notes. For more information, see Note 10  Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 ,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . AbbVie also intends to assume all the existing indebtedness of Allergan and its subsidiaries. AbbVies substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio following the consummation of the Acquisition may have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, lowering its credit ratings, increasing its borrowing costs and/or requiring it to reduce or delay investments, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness.  Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock  AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 , "" Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.  An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions 18    |  2019 Form 10-K   (including AbbVie's pending acquisition of Allergan), or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.  Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.   2019 Form 10-K  |   19 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 . This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition. 2019 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2019 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $33.3 billion , operating earnings of $13.0 billion , diluted earnings per share of $5.28 and cash flows from operations of $13.3 billion . Worldwide net revenues grew by 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA as well as the continued strength of HUMIRA in the U.S. and newly launched immunology assets SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, offset by international HUMIRA biosimilar competition. Diluted earnings per share in 2019 was $5.28 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $3.2 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.3 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $823 million net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) $364 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPRD); and (v) $338 million of expenses related to the proposed Allergan acquisition. These costs were partially offset by the following after-tax benefits: (i) $414 million from litigation matters primarily due to the settlement of an intellectual property dispute with a third party ; (ii) $400 million due to the favorable resolution of various tax positions; and (iii) $297 million from an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata). Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVies emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVies on-market brands. In November 2019 , AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock payable in February 2020 . This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock. 26    |  2019 Form 10-K   2020 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches and driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market; (ii) continuing to invest and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing incremental debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:  Completion and successful integration of the proposed Allergan acquisition.  Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.  Immunology revenue growth driven by successful commercial launches of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, as well as HUMIRA U.S. sales growth.  Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion.  The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2020 . These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7 . AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan will create a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline will be enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio will benefit from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, approximately 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology RINVOQ  In February 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review AbbVie's New Drug Application (NDA) for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  In February 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with giant cell arteritis.   2019 Form 10-K  |   27  In August 2019, the FDA approved RINVOQ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.  In October 2019, AbbVie announced top-line results from its first Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Results from the SELECT-PsA 2 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.  In November 2019, AbbVie announced data from the Phase 2/3 SELECT-AXIS 1 trial in which twice as many adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with RINVOQ achieved the primary endpoint at week 14 versus placebo. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.  In November 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis.  In December 2019, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for RINVOQ for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs.  In February 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active PsA. Results from the SELECT-PsA 1 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more non-biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected. SKYRIZI  In March 2019, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, in subjects with psoriatic arthritis.  In April 2019, the FDA approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  In April 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. Oncology IMBRUVICA  In January 2019, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with GAZYVA (obinutuzumab), for adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  In June 2019, AbbVie announced results from the Phase 3 CLL12 trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL, which demonstrated that IMBRUVICA significantly improved event- and progression-free survival.  In November 2019, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab for the first-line treatment of younger patients with CLL or SLL. VENCLEXTA  In March 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The partial clinical hold followed a review of data from the ongoing Phase 3 BELLINI trial, a study in relapsed/refractory MM, in which a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the VENCLEXTA arm compared to the control arm of the trial. In June 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the Phase 3 CANOVA trial, evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of relapsed/refractory MM positive for the translocation (11;14) abnormality, based upon agreement on revisions to the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. This action does not impact any of the approved indications for VENCLEXTA, such as CLL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 28    |  2019 Form 10-K    In May 2019, the FDA approved VENCLEXTA, in combination with obinutuzumab, for adult patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. The approval was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL, which demonstrated that VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab prolonged progression-free survival and achieved higher rates of complete response and minimal residual disease-negativity compared to commonly used standard of care obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil.  In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion for VENCLYXTO in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with previously untreated CLL. Depatux-M  In May 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 INTELLANCE-1 study of depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M, previously known as ABT-414) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, whose tumors have EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) amplification, at an interim analysis. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in INTELLANCE-1 due to lack of survival benefit for patients receiving Depatux-M compared with placebo when added to the standard regimen of radiation and temozolomide. Enrollment has been halted in all ongoing Depatux-M studies. Veliparib  In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 BROCADE3 study evaluating veliparib, an investigational, oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with HER2 negative germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer.  In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 VELIA study, conducted in collaboration with the GOG Foundation, Inc., evaluating veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by veliparib maintenance therapy met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status. Rova-T  In August 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to terminate the MERU trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as a first-line maintenance therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended terminating the study after results demonstrated no survival benefit at a pre-planned interim analysis for patients receiving Rova-T as compared with placebo. With the closing of the MERU trial, AbbVie announced the termination of the Rova-T research and development program. Virology/Liver Disease  In August 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-nave, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with genotype (GT)1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 infection.  In September 2019, the FDA approved MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-nave, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients across all genotypes (GT1-6).  In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the CHMP of the EMA has recommended a change to the marketing authorization for MAVIRET to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-nave, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with GT 3 infection. Neuroscience  In May 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-951, a subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, in subjects with Parkinson's disease.  In July 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 2 ARISE study evaluating ABBV-8E12, an investigational anti-tau antibody, in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, after an Independent Data   2019 Form 10-K  |   29 Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial for futility after the trial showed that ABBV-8E12 did not provide efficacy. Other  In July 2019, AbbVie submitted an NDA to the FDA for elagolix in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) daily add-back therapy for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales decreased 3% in 2019 and increased 7% in 2018 . The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets, partially offset by market growth across therapeutic categories. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 9% in 2019 and 11% in 2018 . The sales increases in 2019 and 2018 were primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues decreased 28% in 2019 and increased 1% in 2018 . The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA. Net revenues for SKYRIZI were $355 million in 2019 following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Net revenues for RINVOQ were $47 million in 2019 following the August 2019 FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 30% in 2019 and 39% in 2018 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to market share gains following additional regulatory approvals of VENCLEXTA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML in 2018 and first-line CLL in 2019. Global MAVYRET sales decreased by 15% in 2019 primarily driven by lower patient volumes in certain international markets and competitive dynamics in the U.S. Global MAVYRET sales increased more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 78% in 2019 and 76% in 2018 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET. Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2019 and 12% in 2018 , primarily driven by continued market growth and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. Net revenues for Duodopa increased 12% in 2019 and 18% in 2018 , primarily driven by increased market penetration. Gross Margin        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Gross margin $ 25,827  $ 25,035  $ 21,174  %  % as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 increased from 2018 primarily due to the full year effect of the expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement and unfavorable impact from higher intangible asset amortization. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. 32    |  2019 Form 10-K   Selling, General and Administrative        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Selling, general and administrative $ 6,942  $ 7,399  $ 6,295  (6 )%  % as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 decreased from 2018 primarily due to the favorable impacts of international HUMIRA expense reductions and lower litigation reserve charges that decreased by $326 million . This favorability was partially offset by new product launch expenses, higher restructuring charges and $103 million of transaction expenses associated with the proposed Allergan transaction. Additionally, SGA expenses in 2018 included non-recurring philanthropic contributions of $350 million to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations. SGA expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to new product launch expenses and non-recurring philanthropic contributions to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Research and development $ 6,407  $ 10,329  $ 5,007  (38 )%  100% as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Acquired in-process research and development $  $  $  (9 )%  % Research and Development (RD) expenses decreased in 2019 and increased in 2018 principally due to impairment charges related to IPRD acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. In 2019, the company recorded a $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge which represented the remaining value of the IPRD acquired following the decision to terminate the Rova-T RD program. In 2018, the company recorded a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial, which lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these impairment charges. Acquired IPRD expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019 or 2018. Acquired IPRD expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement. Other Operating Expenses and Income Other operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata . See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Calico agreement.   2019 Form 10-K  |   33 Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions)    Interest expense  $ 1,784  $ 1,348  $ 1,150 Interest income  (275 )  (204 )  (146 ) Interest expense, net  $ 1,509  $ 1,144  $ 1,004        Net foreign exchange loss  $  $  $ Other expense, net  3,006   Interest expense in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to $363 million of incremental interest and debt issuance costs associated with financing the proposed acquisition of Allergan, as well as the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations. Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018 . Interest income in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance during 2019, partially offset by decreased investments in debt securities. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $3.1 billion in 2019 , $49 million in 2018 and $626 million in 2017 . The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2019 , the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T RD program during the third quarter of 2019. In 2018 , the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. This increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage Stemcentrx assets. In 2017 , the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 6% in 2019 , negative 9% in 2018 and 31% in 2017 . The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2019 over the prior year was principally due to the timing of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. The increase is also attributable to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including a change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. These increases were partially offset by the favorable resolution of various tax positions in the current year. The effective tax rate for 2018 also included the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes. 34    |  2019 Form 10-K   The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions)   Cash flows from:      Operating activities $ 13,324  $ 13,427  $ 9,960 Investing activities  (1,006 )  (274 ) Financing activities 18,708  (14,396 )  (5,512 ) Operating cash flows in 2019 decreased slightly from 2018 primarily due to higher payments for income taxes offset by improved results of operations resulting from an increase in operating earnings. Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVies contributions to its defined benefit plans of $727 million in 2019 , $873 million in 2018 and $246 million in 2017 . Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million . Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million . Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million . Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes at maturities ranging from 18 months to 30 years . AbbVie expects to use the net proceeds of $29.8 billion to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the proposed acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition, the net proceeds from the offering are permitted to be invested temporarily in short-term investments. All of the notes are subject to special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if the proposed acquisition of Allergan is not completed by January 30, 2021 or the company notifies the trustee in respect of the notes that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition. Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Financing cash flows in 2018 included proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion drawn under the term loan in June 2018. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and there was $699 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018 . AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Cash dividend payments totaled $6.4 billion in 2019 , $5.6 billion in 2018 and $4.1 billion in 2017 . The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 1, 2019 , AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.07 per share to $1.18 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2020 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2020 . This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's   2019 Form 10-K  |   35 debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019 and 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018 and 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017. AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017. In 2019, AbbVie made contingent consideration milestone and royalty payments to BI totaling $234 million following the commercial launch of SKYRIZI in certain geographies. $163 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $71 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows. In connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan, on June 25, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $38.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and on July 12, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement. The company incurred a total of $242 million of debt issuance costs related to the two agreements. On October 25, 2019, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for up to $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount and 3.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash, subject to conditions including the closing of the proposed acquisition. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In February 2020, the remaining commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $0 as a result of cash on hand at AbbVie. AbbVie subsequently terminated the bridge credit agreement in its entirety as permitted under its terms. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2019 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. 36    |  2019 Form 10-K   Credit Ratings Following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Allergan and the $30.0 billion senior notes issuance, Moody's Investor Service affirmed its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. SP Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable and expects to lower the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1 when the acquisition is complete. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 : (in millions) Total  Less than one year  One to three years  Three to five years  More than five years Long-term debt, including current portion $ 67,233  $ 3,750  $ 14,150  $ 7,625  $ 41,708 Interest on long-term debt (a) 30,494  2,146  4,087  3,479  20,782 Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments (f)     Purchase obligations and other (b) 3,532  3,295    Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) 11,544   1,395  2,123  7,860 Total $ 113,577  $ 9,486  $ 20,042  $ 13,397  $ 70,652 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2019 . Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019 . See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019 . (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. (d) Includes $7.3 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (e) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities. (f) Lease payments include approximately $350 million of contractual minimum lease payments for leases executed but not yet commenced. These leases will commence in 2020 with lease terms of approximately 11 years . AbbVie enters into RD collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual   2019 Form 10-K  |   37 obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $18.8 billion in 2019 , $16.4 billion in 2018 and $12.9 billion in 2017 . Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. 38    |  2019 Form 10-K   The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2019 . Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates  Managed Care Rebates  Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 1,167  $ 1,167  $ Provisions 2,909  3,990  5,026 Payments (2,736 )  (3,962 )  (4,887 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 1,340  1,195  Provisions 3,493  4,729  6,659 Payments (3,188 )  (4,485 )  (6,525 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 1,645  1,439  Provisions 4,035  5,772  7,947 Payments (3,915 )  (5,275 )  (7,917 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,765  $ 1,936  $ Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2019 , $1.6 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2017 , are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2019 . A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 :  50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Defined benefit plans    Service and interest cost $ (76 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (723 )  Other post-employment plans    Service and interest cost $ (11 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (101 )  The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The   2019 Form 10-K  |   39 current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 . A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2020 by $71 million . The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 . A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 :  One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service and interest cost $  $ (28 ) Projected benefit obligation  (186 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPRD acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPRD acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial 40    |  2019 Form 10-K   performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2019 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $280 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2019 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $150 million .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 :   (in millions) Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)  Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:            Euro $ 6,217  1.116  $ (12 )  $ 6,660  1.157  $ Japanese yen  108.7    1,076  111.5  (12 ) Canadian dollar  1.324  (6 )   1.314  British pound  1.305  (6 )   1.328  All other currencies 1,508  n/a  (10 )  1,370  n/a  Total $ 9,476    $ (34 )  $ 10,011    $ The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $942 million at December 31, 2019 . If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , the company has 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $280 million at December 31, 2019 . If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019 . A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 42    |  2019 Form 10-K   "," ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). See Note 5 for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer.   2019 Form 10-K  |   49 For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (RD) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 1.1 billion in 2019 , $ 1.1 billion in 2018 and $ 846 million in 2017 . Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five -year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of time deposits, marketable debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and equity securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any 50    |  2019 Form 10-K   unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie also considers industry factors and general market trends. When AbbVie determines that an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, the cost basis of the investment is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 46 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 51 million at December 31, 2018 . Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions)  Finished goods $  $ Work-in-process  Raw materials  Inventories $ 1,813  $ 1,605 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions)  Land $  $ Buildings 1,613  1,603 Equipment 6,012  6,362 Construction in progress  Property and equipment, gross 8,188  8,396 Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,226 )  ( 5,513 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,962  $ 2,883 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 464 million in 2019 , $ 471 million in 2018 and $ 425 million in 2017 .   2019 Form 10-K  |   51 Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease 52    |  2019 Form 10-K   the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPRD projects acquired are expensed as IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPRD projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. RD costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-02 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The standard outlined a comprehensive lease accounting model that superseded the previous lease guidance and required lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also changed the definition of a lease and expanded the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018 have been presented in accordance with the standard, while results for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with AbbVie's historical accounting. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new leases standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The company elected a package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 and did not reassess historical conclusions on: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs capitalization for any existing leases.   2019 Form 10-K  |   53 Under the new standard, on January 1, 2019, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to the recognition of liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases. The adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet included: (i) a $ 405 million increase to other assets; (ii) a $ 115 million increase to accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and (iii) a $ 290 million increase to other long-term liabilities. Other cumulative-effect adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. Adoption of the standard did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's consolidated statement of earnings in 2019. ASU No. 2018-02 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allowed a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act). AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. Upon adoption, the company made an election to not reclassify the income tax effects of the Act from AOCI to retained earnings. Therefore, the adoption of the standard had no impact on AbbVie's consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. Additionally, the standard requires new disclosures and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2020. With certain exceptions, adjustments are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach by reflecting adjustments through a cumulative-effect impact to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie has completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements based on the company's current portfolio of financial assets. ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 54    |  2019 Form 10-K   Note 3  Supplemental Financial Information  Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions)   Interest expense $ 1,784  $ 1,348  $ 1,150 Interest income ( 275 )  ( 204 )  ( 146 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,509  $ 1,144  $ 1,004 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Sales rebates $ 4,484  $ 3,939 Dividends payable 1,771  1,607 Accounts payable 1,452  1,546 Salaries, wages and commissions  Royalty and license arrangements  Other 2,971  3,748 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 11,832  $ 11,931 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Contingent consideration liabilities $ 7,201  $ 4,306 Income taxes payable 3,453  4,311 Pension and other post-employment benefits 2,949  1,840 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 2,772  2,726 Other 1,222  1,307 Other long-term liabilities $ 17,597  $ 14,490 Note 4 Earnings Per Share  AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.   2019 Form 10-K  |   55 The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:  Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data)   Basic EPS      Net earnings $ 7,882  $ 5,687  $ 5,309 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 7,842 $ 5,657 $ 5,283 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,481  1,541  1,596 Basic earnings per share $ 5.30  $ 3.67  $ 3.31       Diluted EPS      Net earnings $ 7,882  $ 5,687  $ 5,309 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 7,842  $ 5,657  $ 5,283 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,481  1,541  1,596 Effect of dilutive securities   Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,484  1,546  1,603 Diluted earnings per share $ 5.28  $ 3.66  $ 3.30 Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements  Proposed Acquisition of Allergan plc On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan) in a cash and stock transaction for a transaction equity value of approximately $ 63 billion , based on the closing price of AbbVies common stock of $ 78.45 on June 24, 2019. Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $ 120.30 in cash for each Allergan share. On October 14, 2019, Allergan shareholders approved the proposed transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. Allergan markets a portfolio of brands and products primarily focused on key therapeutic areas including aesthetics, eye care, neuroscience, gastroenterology and women's health. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. In September 2019, AbbVie and Allergan each received a Request for Additional Information (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the transaction. AbbVie and Allergan are cooperating fully with the FTC. In January 2020, the European Commission approved the proposed acquisition of Allergan by AbbVie conditional upon the divestiture of brazikumab, Allergan's IL-23 inhibitor pipeline product. In January 2020, Allergan entered into a definitive agreement to divest brazikumab contingent upon regulatory approvals and closing of AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan. In anticipation of the proposed acquisition, AbbVie entered into several debt and financing arrangements in 2019. See Note 10 for additional information. Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.1 billion in 2019 , $ 736 million in 2018 and $ 308 million in 2017 . AbbVie recorded acquired IPRD charges of $ 385 million in 2019 , $ 424 million in 2018 and $ 327 million in 2017 . Significant arrangements impacting 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. 56    |  2019 Form 10-K   Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In October 2019, AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) entered into an amended and restated license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reata reacquired exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights concerning its proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie for territories outside of the United States with respect to bardoxolone methyl and worldwide with respect to omaveloxolone and other next-generation Nrf2 activators . As consideration for the rights reacquired by Reata, AbbVie will receive a total of $ 330 million in cash payable in three installments through 2021, which was recognized in other operating expense (income) in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, AbbVie will receive low single-digit, tiered royalties from worldwide sales of omaveloxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators. Calico Life Sciences LLC In June 2018, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of a collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $ 500 million to the collaboration and the term is extended for an additional three years . Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2022 and will advance collaboration projects through Phase 2a through 2027. Following completion of Phase 2a, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license collaboration compounds. AbbVie will support Calico in its early research and development efforts and, upon exercise, would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During 2018, AbbVie recorded $ 500 million in other operating expense (income) in the consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement. Alector, Inc. In October 2017, AbbVie entered into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets, and AbbVie has an option to global development and commercial rights to two targets. The terms of the arrangement included an initial upfront payment of $ 205 million , which was expensed to IPRD in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alector will conduct exploratory research, drug discovery and development for lead programs up to the conclusion of the proof of concept studies. If the option is exercised, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities and could make additional payments to Alector of up to $ 986 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Alector and AbbVie will co-fund development and commercialization and will share global profits equally. Other Arrangements In addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPRD of $ 385 million in 2019 , $ 424 million in 2018 and $ 122 million in 2017 . In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2019 , AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $ 5.8 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Note 6 Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.  In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson  Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to IMBRUVICA, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $ 200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60 % of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40 % of collaboration development costs.   2019 Form 10-K  |   57 In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of IMBRUVICA are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie: years ended December 31 (in millions)    United States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold)  $ 1,803  $ 1,372  $ 1,001 International - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues)    Global - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items)    AbbVies receivable from Janssen, included in accounts receivable, net, was $ 235 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 177 million at December 31, 2018 . AbbVies payable to Janssen, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $ 455 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 376 million at December 31, 2018 .

As of December 31, 2019 , there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets:   as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount  Accumulated amortization  Net carrying amount  Gross carrying amount  Accumulated amortization  Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets            Developed product rights $ 19,547  $ ( 6,405 )  $ 13,142  $ 15,872  $ ( 5,614 )  $ 10,258 License agreements 7,798  ( 2,291 )  5,507  7,865  ( 1,810 )  6,055 Total definite-lived intangible assets 27,345  ( 8,696 )  18,649  23,737  ( 7,424 )  16,313 Indefinite-lived research and development       4,920    4,920 Total intangible assets, net $ 27,345  $ ( 8,696 )  $ 18,649  $ 28,657  $ ( 7,424 )  $ 21,233 58    |  2019 Form 10-K   Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPRD associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. In April 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. As a result, AbbVie reclassified $ 3.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to SKYRIZI to developed product rights definite-lived intangible assets. This amount will be amortized over its estimated useful life using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company made a decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as a second-line therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer following a recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This decision lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate for impairment the IPRD assets associated with the Stemcentrx acquisition. The company utilized multi-period excess earnings models of the income approach and determined that the fair value was $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, which was lower than the carrying value of $ 6.1 billion and resulted in an impairment charge of $ 5.1 billion . This impairment charge was recorded to RD expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, following the announcement of the decision to terminate the Rova-T research and development program, the company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.0 billion which represented the remaining value of the IPRD acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. This impairment charge was recorded to RD expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. No indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2017 . Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 2 to 16 years with an average of 11 years for both developed product rights and license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 1.6 billion in 2019 , $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and $ 1.1 billion in 2017 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: (in billions)     Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 1.8  $ 2.0  $ 2.3  $ 2.4  $ 2.5 No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2019 or 2018 . In 2017, an impairment charge of $ 354 million was recorded related to ZINBRYTA that reduced both the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of the underlying intangible assets due to lower expected future cash flows for the product. The impairment charge was based on discounted cash flow analyses and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. Note 8 Restructuring Plans  AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and RD operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $ 234 million in 2019 , $ 70 million in 2018 and $ 86 million in 2017 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded in cost of products sold, RD expense and SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or operations.   2019 Form 10-K  |   59 The following table summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (in millions)  Accrued balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 2017 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments ( 87 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2017 2018 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments ( 46 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2018 2019 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments ( 178 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2019 $ Note 9 Leases   AbbVie's lease portfolio primarily consists of real estate properties, vehicles and equipment.

Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases as of December 31, 2018 prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 did not differ materially from future lease payments, inclusive of payments for leases executed but not yet commenced, under the new standard.   2019 Form 10-K  |   61 Note 10 Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies  The following table summarizes long-term debt: as of December 31 (dollars in millions) Effective interest rate in 2019 (a)   Effective interest rate in 2018 (a)  Senior notes issued in 2012        2.90% notes due 2022 2.97 %  $ 3,100  2.97 %  $ 3,100 4.40% notes due 2042 4.46 %  2,600  4.46 %  2,600 Senior notes issued in 2015        2.50% notes due 2020 2.65 %  3,750  2.65 %  3,750 3.20% notes due 2022 3.28 %  1,000  3.28 %  1,000 3.60% notes due 2025 3.66 %  3,750  3.66 %  3,750 4.50% notes due 2035 4.58 %  2,500  4.58 %  2,500 4.70% notes due 2045 4.73 %  2,700  4.73 %  2,700 Senior notes issued in 2016        2.30% notes due 2021 2.40 %  1,800  2.40 %  1,800 2.85% notes due 2023 2.91 %  1,000  2.91 %  1,000 3.20% notes due 2026 3.28 %  2,000  3.28 %  2,000 4.30% notes due 2036 4.37 %  1,000  4.37 %  1,000 4.45% notes due 2046 4.50 %  2,000  4.50 %  2,000 Senior Euro notes issued in 2016        0.375% notes due 2019 (1,400 principal) 0.55 %    0.55 %  1,604 1.375% notes due 2024 (1,450 principal) 1.46 %  1,625  1.46 %  1,661 2.125% notes due 2028 (750 principal) 2.18 %   2.18 %  Senior notes issued in 2018        3.375% notes due 2021 3.51 %  1,250  3.51 %  1,250 3.75% notes due 2023 3.84 %  1,250  3.84 %  1,250 4.25% notes due 2028 4.38 %  1,750  4.38 %  1,750 4.875% notes due 2048 4.94 %  1,750  4.94 %  1,750 Senior Euro notes issued in 2019        0.75% notes due 2027 (750 principal) 0.86 %      1.25% notes due 2031 (650 principal) 1.30 %      Senior notes issued in 2019        Floating rate notes due May 2021 2.08 %      Floating rate notes due November 2021 2.12 %      Floating rate notes due 2022 2.29 %      2.15% notes due 2021 2.23 %  1,750     2.30% notes due 2022 2.42 %  3,000     2.60% notes due 2024 2.69 %  3,750     2.95% notes due 2026 3.02 %  4,000     3.20% notes due 2029 3.25 %  5,500     4.05% notes due 2039 4.11 %  4,000     4.25% notes due 2049 4.29 %  5,750     Other    Fair value hedges   ( 48 )    ( 466 ) Unamortized bond discounts   ( 161 )    ( 120 ) Unamortized deferred financing costs   ( 323 )    ( 163 ) Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations   66,728    36,611 Current portion   3,753    1,609 Noncurrent portion   $ 62,975    $ 35,002 (a) Excludes the effect of any related interest rate swaps. 62    |  2019 Form 10-K   Allergan-Related Financing In connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan, in November 2019, the company issued $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due May 2021, $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due November 2021, $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022, $ 1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15 % senior notes due 2021, $ 3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.30 % senior notes due 2022, $ 3.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60 % senior notes due 2024, $ 4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95 % senior notes due 2026, $ 5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.20 % senior notes due 2029, $ 4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.05 % senior notes due 2039 and $ 5.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25 % senior notes due 2049. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. With exception of the fixed-rate notes due 2021 and 2022, AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 173 million and debt discounts totaled $ 52 million , which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie expects to use the net proceeds to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the proposed acquisition described in Note 5 and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition, the net proceeds from the offering are permitted to be invested temporarily in short-term investments. All of the notes are subject to special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101 % of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if the proposed acquisition of Allergan is not completed by January 30, 2021 or the company notifies the trustee in respect of the notes that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $ 38.0 billion 364 -day bridge credit agreement. On July 12, 2019, AbbVie entered into a term loan credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of $ 6.0 billion consisting of a $ 1.5 billion 364 -day term loan tranche, a $ 2.5 billion three-year term loan tranche and a $ 2.0 billion five-year term loan tranche. In connection with the agreements, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 242 million and were recorded to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Upon commencement of the $ 6.0 billion term loan credit agreement and upon issuance of the $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $ 2.0 billion . No amounts were drawn under the bridge credit agreement or term loan credit agreement at December 31, 2019 . In February 2020, the remaining commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $ 0 as a result of cash on hand at AbbVie. AbbVie subsequently terminated the bridge credit agreement in its entirety as permitted under its terms. On October 25, 2019, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for up to $ 15.5 billion aggregate principal amount and  3.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash, subject to conditions including the closing of the pending acquisition of Allergan. Concurrently with the offers to exchange the Allergan notes for AbbVie notes, the company solicited consents to adopt certain proposed amendments to each of the indentures governing the Allergan notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indentures. In November 2019, the company announced that the requisite number of consents had been received to adopt the proposed amendments with respect to all Allergan notes and that Allergan executed a supplemental indenture with respect to each Allergan indenture implementing the amendments, which will become operative only upon settlement of the exchange offers. The expiration of the exchange offers is expected to occur on or about the closing date of AbbVies acquisition of Allergan. Other Long-Term Debt In September 2019, the company issued  1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, consisting of  750 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75 % senior notes due 2027 and  650 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25 % senior notes due 2031.

AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures  Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 957 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 , are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months . Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2019 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain will be reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and will be reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2018 . The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had  3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . In the third quarter of 2019, the company issued  1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes and designated the principal amounts of this foreign denominated debt as net investment hedges. Concurrently, the company elected to de-designate hedge accounting for  1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of existing senior Euro notes which were subsequently repaid in October 2019. In addition, in 2019, the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and designated the instruments as net investment hedges. These contracts had notional amounts totaling  971 million ,  204 million and CHF 62 million at December 31, 2019 . The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative   2019 Form 10-K  |   65 instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 10.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 :    Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Total  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets        Cash and equivalents $ 39,924  $ 1,542  $ 38,382  $  Debt securities      Equity securities      Interest rate swap contracts      Foreign currency contracts      Total assets $ 40,004  $ 1,566  $ 38,438  $  Liabilities        Interest rate swap contracts $  $   $  $  Foreign currency contracts      Contingent consideration 7,340      7,340 Total liabilities $ 7,472  $   $  $ 7,340   2019 Form 10-K  |   67 The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 :    Basis of fair value measurement (in millions) Total  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets        Cash and equivalents $ 7,289  $ 1,209  $ 6,080  $  Time deposits      Debt securities 1,536    1,536   Equity securities      Foreign currency contracts      Total assets $ 9,529  $ 1,213  $ 8,316  $  Liabilities        Interest rate swap contracts $  $   $  $  Foreign currency contracts      Contingent consideration 4,483      4,483 Total liabilities $ 4,975  $   $  $ 4,483 The fair values of time deposits approximate their amortized cost due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities were determined based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2019 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $ 280 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2019 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $ 150 million . There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions)   Beginning balance $ 4,483  $ 4,534  $ 4,213 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 3,091   Payments ( 234 )  ( 100 )  ( 305 ) Ending balance $ 7,340  $ 4,483  $ 4,534 The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the SKYRIZI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T research and development program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $ 428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval. 68    |  2019 Form 10-K   Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % in 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2019 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 6.6 % pre-65 ( 7.3 % post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % for 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2019 , a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:  One percentage point year ended December 31, 2019 (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service cost and interest cost $  $ ( 10 ) Projected benefit obligation  ( 186 ) Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets    Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)     Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)     Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 2,851  $ 2,051  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 4,265       Fair value of plan assets $ 7,116    72    |  2019 Form 10-K      Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)     Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)     Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 2,359  $ 1,586  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 3,278       Fair value of plan assets $ 5,637    (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2019 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 35 % in equity securities, 20 % in fixed income securities and 45 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.   2019 Form 10-K  |   73 Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans  Other post-employment plans $  $ 2021  2022  2023  2024  2025 to 2029 1,737  Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plan is the AbbVie Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $ 102 million in 2019 , $ 89 million in 2018 and $ 82 million in 2017 related to this plan. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity  Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows:  Years ended December 31, (in millions)   Cost of products sold $  $  $ Research and development   Selling, general and administrative   Pre-tax compensation expense   Tax benefit   After-tax compensation expense $  $  $ Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 15 million in 2019 , $ 78 million in 2018 and $ 71 million in 2017 . 74    |  2019 Form 10-K   Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 12.54 in 2019 , $ 21.63 in 2018 and $ 9.80 in 2017 . The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2019 : (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options  Weighted- average exercise price  Weighted- average remaining life (in years)  Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 6,143  $ 55.05  6.2  $ Granted 1,002  79.02     Exercised ( 375 )  23.72     Lapsed ( 9 )  20.09     Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6,761  $ 60.39  5.9  $ Exercisable at December 31, 2019 4,924  $ 51.90  4.9  $ The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 22 million in 2019 , $ 215 million in 2018 and $ 371 million in 2017 . The total fair value of options vested during 2019 was $ 13 million . As of December 31, 2019 , $ 6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three -year performance period based on AbbVies ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three -year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVies EPS achievement and AbbVies total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVies common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2019 : (share units in thousands) Share units  Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 9,868  $ 79.90 Granted 5,584  78.03 Vested ( 4,616 )  71.30 Forfeited ( 604 )  82.19 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 10,232  $ 81.72 The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 371 million in 2019 , $ 583 million in 2018 and $ 348 million in 2017 .   2019 Form 10-K  |   75 As of December 31, 2019 , $ 327 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 4.39 in 2019 , $ 3.95 in 2018 and $ 2.63 in 2017 .

The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 . On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $ 5.0 billion increase to the existing $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $ 10.7 billion in 2018. Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and approximately 13 million shares for $ 1.0 billion in 2017 . 76    |  2019 Form 10-K   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments  Net investment hedging activities  Pension and post- employment benefits  Marketable security activities  Cash flow hedging activities  Total Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ ( 1,435 )  $  $ ( 1,513 )  $  $  $ ( 2,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications  ( 343 )  ( 480 )   ( 230 )  ( 344 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss     ( 75 )  ( 112 )  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)  ( 343 )  ( 406 )  ( 46 )  ( 342 )  ( 141 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 ( 439 )  ( 203 )  ( 1,919 )    ( 166 )  ( 2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 391 )    ( 14 )   ( 27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss        Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 391 )    ( 10 )   Balance as of December 31, 2018 ( 830 )  ( 65 )  ( 1,722 )  ( 10 )   ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 )   ( 1,330 )    ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss   ( 21 )   ( 2 )  ( 157 )  ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 )   ( 1,243 )    ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ ( 928 )  $  $ ( 2,965 )  $   $  $ ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive loss included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 98 million in 2019 and $ 391 million in 2018 which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. In 2017, AbbVie reclassified $ 316 million of historical currency translation losses from AOCI related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. These losses were included in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statement of earnings and had no related income tax impacts. Other comprehensive loss in 2017 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $ 680 million , which was principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates.

The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. These changes were generally effective for tax years beginning in 2018. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The companys accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. Additionally, the Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Acts transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings and the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. As such, the company records foreign withholding tax liabilities related to the future cash repatriation of such earnings. However, the company considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation years ended December 31   Statutory tax rate 21.0 %  21.0 %  35.0 % Effect of foreign operations ( 8.4 )  ( 28.7 )  ( 12.2 ) U.S. tax credits ( 3.3 )  ( 7.3 )  ( 4.0 ) Impacts related to U.S. tax reform ( 1.6 )  8.2  12.0 Stock-based compensation excess tax benefit ( 0.2 )  ( 1.5 )  ( 0.9 ) Tax audit settlements ( 4.7 )  ( 2.5 )  ( 1.2 ) Deferred tax remeasurements due to change in tax rate 3.1     All other, net 0.6  1.4  2.6 Effective tax rate 6.5 %  ( 9.4 )%  31.3 % The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law, acquisitions and collaborations. The effective income tax rates in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to changes in enacted tax rates and laws, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, the cost of repatriation decisions, Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration and Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. In 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. For 2019, the impact of the Act affected the full year earnings of these subsidiaries, resulting in additional tax expense compared to prior year. The 2019 effective income tax rate also reflects the effects of deferred tax remeasurement due to a change in foreign tax law, accretion for contingent consideration and impairment related expenses. In addition, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $ 400 million in 2019 , $ 131 million in 2018 and $ 91 million in 2017 related to the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years.   2019 Form 10-K  |   79 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Deferred tax assets    Compensation and employee benefits $  $ Accruals and reserves  Chargebacks and rebates  Advance payments  Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards  Other  Total deferred tax assets 3,517  2,765 Valuation allowances ( 731 )  ( 103 ) Total net deferred tax assets 2,786  2,662 Deferred tax liabilities    Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 2,712 )  ( 2,940 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 249 )  ( 211 ) Other ( 440 )  ( 250 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 3,401 )  ( 3,401 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 615 )  $ ( 739 ) As of December 31, 2019 , gross state net operating losses were $ 1.0 billion and tax credit carryforwards were $ 188 million . The state tax carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2039. As of December 31, 2019 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $ 2.9 billion . Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 2.8 billion expire between 2020 and 2036 and the remaining do not have an expiration period. The company had valuation allowances of $ 731 million as of December 31, 2019 and $ 103 million as of December 31, 2018 . These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized.

AbbVie will be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 2.4 billion in 2019 and $ 2.7 billion in 2018 . Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2019 , AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 83 million . The Increase due to current year tax positions and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 51 million in 2019 , $ 73 million in 2018 and $ 24 million in 2017 , for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross 80    |  2019 Form 10-K   interest and penalties of $ 191 million at December 31, 2019 , $ 190 million at December 31, 2018 and $ 120 million at December 31, 2017 . The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 54 million . All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2012. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $ 290 million as of December 31, 2019 and approximately $ 350 million as of December 31, 2018 . Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. In addition, other operating income in 2019 included $ 550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party . While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Four lawsuits against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others remained consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by direct AndroGel purchasers, generally allege Solvay's 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and attorneys' fees. Three of those lawsuits were settled in December 2019 and will be dismissed. In September 2014, the FTC filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTCs settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $ 448 million , plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTCs request for injunctive relief. AbbVie is appealing the courts liability and disgorgement rulings and, based on an assessment of the merits of that appeal, no liability has been accrued for this matter. The FTC is also appealing aspects of the courts trial ruling and the dismissal of its settlement-related claim. In July 2018, a purported class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of direct AndroGel purchasers based on the trial courts ruling in the FTCs case. In September 2019, two individual direct AndroGel purchasers substituted in as the plaintiffs in that lawsuit and withdrew the class allegations. That case, which was pending as Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was settled in December 2019 and will be dismissed. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, making allegations similar to those in In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation (No. II) , MDL No. 2084 (above) and FTC v. AbbVie Inc. (above). Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern   2019 Form 10-K  |   81 District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorneys Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys fees. In May 2018, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the District Attorneys Office may not bring monetary claims beyond the scope of Orange County, which the District Attorneys Office is appealing. Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect HUMIRA purchasers, alleging that AbbVies settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVies HUMIRA patent portfolio violate state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation . In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payers who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted included violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. In July 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification. In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district courts grant of the defendants summary judgment motion. In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexicos Unfair Practices Act. In September 2018, the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance intervened in a qui tam lawsuit, State of California and Lazaro Suarez v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , brought under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, in California Superior Court for Alameda County. The Department of Insurances complaint alleges that, through patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value provided in connection with HUMIRA, AbbVie caused the submission of fraudulent commercial insurance claims for HUMIRA in violation of the California statute. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an assessment of up to three times the amount of the claims at issue, and civil penalties. In addition, a federal securities lawsuit ( Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al .) is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for HUMIRA sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted the conduct alleged in the Department of Insurances complaint. In November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit, Rubinstein, et al. v Gonzalez, et al., on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc (Shire) securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie's proposed transaction with Shire. In October 2019, the court granted final approval to the parties class settlement agreement. In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connec tion with its proposed t ransaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Product liability cases were filed in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 3,500 claims against AbbVie are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 175 claims against AbbVie are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In November 2018, AbbVie entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee in the MDL encompassing existing claims in all courts. All proceedings in pending cases are effectively stayed during the settlement administration process. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Approximately 120 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and approximately 14 others are pending in various federal and state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Approximately eighty percent of these pending 82    |  2019 Form 10-K   cases, plus other unfiled claims, are subject to confidential settlement agreements and are expected to be dismissed with prejudice. Beginning in May 2016, the Patent Trial  Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent  Trademark Office (PTO) instituted five inter partes review proceedings brought by Coherus Biosciences and Boehringer Ingelheim related to three AbbVie patents covering methods of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis using adalimumab. In these proceedings, the PTO reviewed the validity of the patents and issued decisions of invalidity in May, June and July of 2017. In January 2020, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the decisions. In March 2017, AbbVie filed a lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. v. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. and Grifols Worldwide Operations Ltd. , in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Novartis Vaccines and Grifols Worldwide seeking a declaratory judgment that 11 HCV-related patents licensed to AbbVie in 2002 are invalid. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib capsules (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark IMBRUVICA). In February 2018, cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the following defendants: Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc., and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Limited; Sun Pharma Global FZE and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Cipla Limited and Cipla USA Inc.; and Zydus Worldwide DMCC, Cadila Healthcare Limited, Sandoz Inc., and Lek Pharmaceuticals D.D. In each case, Pharmacyclics alleges the defendants proposed generic ibrutinib product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of IMBRUVICA, is the co-plaintiff in these suits. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark IMBRUVICA). In a case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019, Pharmacyclics alleges that Alvogen Pine Brook LLCs and Natco Pharma Ltd.s proposed generic ibrutinib tablet product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents. Pharmacyclics seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of IMBRUVICA, is the co-plaintiff in this suit.   2019 Form 10-K  |   83 Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information  AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 88    |  2019 Form 10-K     Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Revenue Recognition, the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period as the related product is sold. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $4,484 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of managements controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in managements calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions in light of industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Companys calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy.   Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Business Combinations and in Note 11 under the caption Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures, the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $7,340 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry and knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions.   2019 Form 10-K  |   89 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, managements process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments in light of observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted managements conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Companys Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020 90    |  2019 Form 10-K   "," ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 .   2019 Form 10-K  |   91 Report of independent registered public accounting firm.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020   2019 Form 10-K  |   93 "

It is approved to treat the following autoimmune diseases in the United States, Canada and Mexico (collectively, North America) and in the European Union: Condition  Principal Markets Rheumatoid arthritis (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Psoriatic arthritis  North America, European Union Ankylosing spondylitis  North America, European Union Adult Crohn's disease (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Plaque psoriasis (moderate to severe chronic)  North America, European Union Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (moderate to severe polyarticular)  North America, European Union Ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Axial spondyloarthropathy  European Union Pediatric Crohn's disease (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Hidradenitis Suppurativa (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis  European Union Non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis  North America, European Union HUMIRA is also approved in Japan for the treatment of intestinal Behet's disease. HUMIRA is sold in numerous other markets worldwide, including Japan, China, Brazil and Australia, and accounted for approximately 61% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 . _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms ""AbbVie"" or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.   2018 Form 10-K  |   1 Oncology products.  AbbVies oncology products target some of the most complex and difficult-to-treat cancers. These products are:  IMBRUVICA.  IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is an oral, once-daily therapy that inhibits a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval after being granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is one of the few therapies to receive four separate designations. IMBRUVICA currently is approved for the treatment of adult patients with:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL/SLL with 17p deletion;  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy*;  Waldenstrms macroglobulinemia (WM);  Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy*; and  Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. _______________________________________________________________________________ * Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. VENCLEXTA.  VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) is a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat adults with CLL or SLL, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior treatment. In addition, VENCLEXTA is used in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 75 years of age or older or  have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy.  Virology Products. AbbVie's virology products address unmet needs for patients living with HCV and HIV. HCV products. AbbVie's HCV products are: MAVYRET/MAVIRET. MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (MAVIRET) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. VIEKIRA PAK AND TECHNIVIE. VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) is an all-oral, short-course, interferon-free therapy, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, including those with compensated cirrhosis. In Europe, VIEKIRA PAK is marketed as VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA and is approved for use in patients with genotype 1 and genotype 4 HCV. AbbVie's TECHNIVIE (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) is FDA-approved for use in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of adults with genotype 4 HCV infection in the United States. Additional Virology products. AbbVie's additional virology products include: SYNAGIS. SYNAGIS (palivizumab) is a product marketed by AbbVie outside of the United States that protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). KALETRA. KALETRA (lopinavir/ritonavir), which is also marketed as Aluvia in emerging markets, is a prescription anti-HIV-1 medicine that contains two protease inhibitors: lopinavir and ritonavir. KALETRA is used with other anti-HIV-1 medications as a treatment that maintains viral suppression in people with HIV-1. NORVIR. NORVIR (ritonavir) is a protease inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 2    |  2018 Form 10-K   Metabolics/Hormones products. Metabolic and hormone products target a number of conditions, including testosterone deficiency due to certain underlying conditions, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism. These products include: CREON. CREON (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AndroGel. AndroGel (testosterone gel) is a testosterone replacement therapy for males diagnosed with symptomatic low testosterone due to certain underlying conditions. AbbVie has the rights to sell AndroGel, CREON and Synthroid only in the United States. Endocrinology products. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and LUPRON DEPOT, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection. Other products. AbbVie's other products include: ORILISSA. ORILISSA (elagolix) is the first and only orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. The FDA approved ORILISSA under priority review. It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. ORILISSA inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Duopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa). AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States. Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane (sold under the trademarks Ultane and Sevorane) is an anesthesia product that AbbVie sells worldwide for human use. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States all of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and country regulatory bodies. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. In 2018 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42% of AbbVie's 2018 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. These wholesalers purchase product from AbbVie under standard terms and conditions of sale. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's   2018 Form 10-K  |   3 business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with other available HCV treatment options. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVies competitors could cause revenues for AbbVies products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVies biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. HUMIRA is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, which represent approximately 75% of AbbVie's international HUMIRA business or approximately 25% of total global HUMIRA revenues. AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the Public Health Service Act, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for, and science behind, generic or other follow-on versions of small molecule products. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVies intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a patent term restoration, for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after 4    |  2018 Form 10-K   regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDAs reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over, and more rigorous requirements for approval of, follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2019 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVies business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark HUMIRA), are material in relation to the companys business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark IMBRUVICA) and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (which are sold under the trademarks MAVYRET and MAVIRET). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVies employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.   2018 Form 10-K  |   5 Licensing and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. These licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments (if applicable), milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVies existing portfolio. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:  Phase 1involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing.  Phase 2tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients.  Phase 3tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. 6    |  2018 Form 10-K   In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA or BLA and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). RegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw   2018 Form 10-K  |   7 materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of 8    |  2018 Form 10-K   countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2019 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2018 were approximately $20 million and operating expenditures were approximately $31 million . In 2019 , capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $26 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $33 million . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.   2018 Form 10-K  |   9 Employees AbbVie employed approximately 30,000 persons as of January 31, 2019. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). "," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1 , "" Business Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3 , "" Legal Proceedings ."" The United States composition of matter patent for HUMIRA, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.9 billion in 2018 , expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. 10    |  2018 Form 10-K    AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.  A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.  Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. HUMIRA accounted for approximately 61% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 . Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for HUMIRA, the commercialization of biosimilars of HUMIRA, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of HUMIRA for any reason.  AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of   2018 Form 10-K  |   11 competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.  A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.  Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding HUMIRAcould adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.  AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVies biologic products, including HUMIRA. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVies biologic products, AbbVies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. 12    |  2018 Form 10-K    New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market, and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVies virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVies products, and this could negatively impact AbbVies business and results of operations.  The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.  AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier.  Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product   2018 Form 10-K  |   13 withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products.  AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured.  AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.  AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1 , "" Business RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development."" The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and 14    |  2018 Form 10-K   field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States make up approximately 34% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 . The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability.   2018 Form 10-K  |   15  If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.  AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.  AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2018 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.  AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt.  AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate 16    |  2018 Form 10-K   funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business.  AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVies or third-party providers databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and  changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock  AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 , "" Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.   2018 Form 10-K  |   17  An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions, or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.  Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 18    |  2018 Form 10-K   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 . This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health.  AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses.  In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients.  Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.  Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products.  2018 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2018 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $32.8 billion , operating earnings of $6.4 billion , diluted earnings per share of $3.66 and cash flows from operations of $13.4 billion . Worldwide net revenues grew by 16% , or 15% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by revenue growth related to MAVYRET, IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and the continued strength of HUMIRA. Diluted earnings per share in 2018 was $3.66 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $4.1 billion net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.1 billion of intangible asset amortization; (iii) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico); (iv) $424 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPRD); (v) $478 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities excluding the fair value adjustment associated with the Stemcentrx-related impairment; (vi) litigation reserve charges of $282 million ; (vii) charitable contributions of $271 million as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan to make contributions to U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018; and (viii) milestone payments of $137 million . 2018 financial results were also impacted by U.S. tax reform and the timing of the new legislation's phase in on certain subsidiaries. Additionally, financial results reflected continued added funding to support all stages of AbbVies emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVies growth brands. In November 2018 , AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock payable in February 2019 . This reflected an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share of common stock. 26    |  2018 Form 10-K   2019 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (ii) continued investment and expansion in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:  Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.  The strong execution of new product launches across multiple therapeutic areas.  HUMIRA U.S. sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories and maintaining market leadership.  Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion.  The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2019. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7 . AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Upadacitinib  In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.  In April 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-COMPARE clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are on a stable background of methotrexate and who have an inadequate response. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported clinical trials and no new safety signals were detected.   2018 Form 10-K  |   27  In June 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-EARLY clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib versus methotrexate in adult patients with moderate to severe RA who were methotrexate-nave met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported clinical trials and no new safety signals were detected.  In July 2018, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.  In September 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.  In December 2018, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for upadacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe RA. Risankizumab  In January 2018, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohns disease.  In February 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating risankizumab with 12-week dosing compared to ustekinumab met ranked additional secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The initial results from these clinical trials were previously announced in October 2017. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the two studies.  In April 2018, AbbVie submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for risankizumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults.  In May 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Oncology IMBRUVICA  In April 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA versus chlorambucil plus GAZYVA (obinutuzumab) for the first-line treatment of subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  In May 2018, AbbVie announced that results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with GAZYVA in previously untreated CLL/SLL met its primary endpoint. In December 2018, AbbVie announced additional results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study that demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS).  In June 2018, AbbVie announced that results from an interim analysis of the Phase 3 iNNOVATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA plus Rituxan (rituximab) in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients with Waldenstrms macroglobulinemia (WM) met its primary endpoint.  In July 2018, AbbVie announced that results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the addition of IMBRUVICA to a chemotherapy regimen consisting of five different agents used in combination did not meet its primary endpoint in a subset of untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients identified to have the non-germinal center B-cell or activated B-cell subtypes of this disease.  In August 2018, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with Rituxan, for the treatment of adult patients with WM.  In December 2018, AbbVie announced that results from an interim analysis of the Phase 3 ECOG1912E study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan versus the chemoimmunotherapy FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab) in previously untreated and younger CLL patients met its primary endpoint.  In January 2019, AbbVie announced an update on the Phase 3 RESOLVE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine combination in patients 28    |  2018 Form 10-K   with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Results showed the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving PFS or overall survival (OS) benefit among the study population. Safety data collected from the study were consistent with the existing safety information for the study therapies.  In January 2019, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with GAZYVA, for adult patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. VENCLEXTA  In January 2018, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA for VENCLEXTA monotherapy in patients with CLL who are refractory to or have relapsed B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors.  In June 2018, the FDA approved VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. VENCLEXTA plus Rituxan is the first oral-based, chemotherapy-free combination in CLL that allows patients an option for fixed treatment duration.  In September 2018, the FDA expanded the label for VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan to include information about patients with previously-treated CLL who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the Phase 3 MURANO trial.  In October 2018, the European Commission approved the type-II variation application for VENCLYXTO in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of patients with R/R CLL who have received at least one prior therapy. In November, AbbVie received notification from the European Commission that conditions of the original conditional marketing authorisation have been fulfilled, granting VENCLYXTO official receipt of approval.  In October 2018, AbbVie announced that the results from the Phase 3 CLL14 study comparing the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL and coexisting medical conditions met its primary endpoint.  In November 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low dose cytarabine (LDAC) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rates. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Rova-T  In March 2018, AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 2 TRINITY study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) for third-line R/R small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although Rova-T demonstrated single agent responses in advanced SCLC patients, after consulting with the FDA, based on the magnitude of effect across multiple parameters in this single-arm study, the company will not seek accelerated approval for Rova-T in third-line R/R SCLC.  In December 2018, AbbVie announced the decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating Rova-T as a second-line therapy for advanced SCLC. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in TAHOE due to shorter overall survival in the Rova-T arm compared with the topotecan control arm. AbbVie will continue its ongoing Phase 3 study of Rova-T in first-line SCLC. Other  In November 2018, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) announced that the FDA expanded the label for Empliciti in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies. BMS and AbbVie are co-developing Empliciti, with BMS solely responsible for commercial activities.   2018 Form 10-K  |   29 Virology/Liver Disease  In November 2018, AbbVie presented EXPEDITION 8 data at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), in which 8 weeks of MAVYRET in treatment nave, cirrhotic patients was safe and effective with no virologic failures reported. Neuroscience  In March 2018, Biogen and AbbVie announced the voluntary worldwide withdrawal of marketing authorizations for ZINBRYTA, a prescription medicine used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Other  In February 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-I study evaluating elagolix, an investigational, orally administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, being investigated in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids met its primary efficacy endpoint and all ranked secondary endpoints.  In March 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-II study evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids met its primary efficacy endpoint and all ranked secondary endpoints.  In July 2018, the FDA approved ORILISSA (elagolix) for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.  In August 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-EXTEND study evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids were consistent with findings observed in the ELARIS UF-I and ELARIS UF-II Phase 3 studies.  In October 2018, AbbVie announced that it will assume full development and commercial responsibility for its collaboration with Galapagos to discover and develop new therapies to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). Under a revised agreement, AbbVie will assume full development and commercial responsibility over the investigational program comprising several clinical and pre-clinical compounds originally discovered and developed jointly by AbbVie and Galapagos. Galapagos will not pursue further research and development in CF, but is eligible for future milestones and royalties on commercialized programs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales increased 7% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 . The sales increases in 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 11% in 2018 and 18% in 2017 . The sales increase in 2018 and 2017 was driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 1% in 2018 and 7% in 2017 . The sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. Due to the entry of biosimilar competition, AbbVie expects international HUMIRA net revenues to decline in 2019. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 39% in 2018 and 40% in 2017 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2018 primarily due to market share gains following FDA and EMA approvals of VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan for certain patients with R/R CLL. Global MAVYRET sales increased by more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion in 2018. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 76% in 2018 and 49% in 2017 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET. Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 , driven primarily by continued market growth, higher market share and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. AndroGel net revenues decreased 19% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 primarily due to market contraction and the entry of generic competition for the AndroGel 1.62% formulation in October 2018. AbbVie expects net revenues for AndroGel to continue to decline in 2019. Net revenues for Duodopa increased 18% in 2018 and 20% in 2017 , primarily as a result of market penetration. Gross Margin        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Gross margin $ 25,035  $ 21,174  $ 19,806  %  % as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million in 2017, as well as the unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization and the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. These drivers were partially offset by lower amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics as well as favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Selling, general and administrative $ 7,399  $ 6,295  $ 5,881  %  % as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of new product launch expenses and charitable contributions of $350 million to 32    |  2018 Form 10-K   select U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018 as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth. SGA expense percentage in 2017 decreased from 2016 . SGA expense percentage in 2017 was favorably impacted by continued leverage from revenue growth partially offset by litigation reserves charges that increased by $370 million in 2017 compared to the prior year and new product launch expenses. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions)     Research and development $ 10,329  $ 5,007  $ 4,385  100%  % as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     Acquired in-process research and development $  $  $  %  % Research and Development  (RD) expenses in 2018 increased from 2017 principally due to a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge related to IPRD acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial. The impairment was primarily due to lower probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. The remaining increase reflected greater funding to support all stages of the company's pipeline assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. RD expenses in 2017 increased from 2016 principally due to increased funding to support all stages of the companys pipeline assets, the impact of the post-acquisition RD expenses of Stemcentrx and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) compounds and an increase in development milestones of $63 million . These factors were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs of $135 million . Acquired IPRD expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2018. Acquired IPRD expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2016. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions)    Interest expense  $ 1,348  $ 1,150  $ 1,047 Interest income  (204 )  (146 )  (82 ) Interest expense, net  $ 1,144  $ 1,004 $        Net foreign exchange loss  $  $  $ Other expense, net    Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018. Interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Interest income in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in the companys investment securities.   2018 Form 10-K  |   33 Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVies net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities of $49 million in 2018 , $626 million in 2017 and $228 million in 2016 . The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2018 , the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. The increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. In 2017 , the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. In 2016 , the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was negative 9% in 2018 , was 31% in 2017 and was 24% in 2016 . The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the impact of the effective date of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses. Given these factors, the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes. The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act. The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions)   Cash flows from:      Operating activities $ 13,427  $ 9,960  $ 7,041 Investing activities (1,006 )  (274 )  (6,074 ) Financing activities (14,396 )  (5,512 )  (3,928 ) Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows in 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, an improvement in operating earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $78 million in 2018 and $71 million in 2017 and were presented within operating cash flows as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. Prior to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement, realized excess benefits of $55 million in 2016 were presented within cash flows from financing activities. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVies contributions to its defined benefit plans of $873 million in 2018, $246 million in 2017 and $273 million in 2016. 34    |  2018 Form 10-K   Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million . Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million . Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, a $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016, net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $479 million . In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $699 million as of December 31, 2018 and $400 million as of December 31, 2017 . AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included proceeds from the issuance of a $3.0 billion  364 -day term loan credit agreement (term loan) entered into in May 2018 . In June 2018, the company drew on this term loan and as of December 31, 2018 , $3.0 billion was outstanding and was included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at one month LIBOR plus applicable margin. The term loan may be prepaid without penalty upon prior notice and contains customary covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2018 . In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. The company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay term loan obligations in 2019 as they become due. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an accelerated share repurchase (ASR). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2016 ASR transaction. Cash dividend payments totaled $5.6 billion in 2018 , $4.1 billion in 2017 and $3.7 billion in 2016 . The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 2, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2019 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2019. This reflects an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.  On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018, approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 and approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 . AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016. In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows.   2018 Form 10-K  |   35 Cash and equivalents were impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $39 million in 2018 , net favorable exchange rate changes totaling $29 million in 2017 and net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 . The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2018 were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility In August 2018, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion  five -year revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings There were no changes in the companys credit ratings during 2018 . Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt obligations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 : (in millions) Total  Less than one year  One to three years  Three to five years  More than five years Short-term borrowings $ 3,699  $ 3,699  $   $   $  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 37,360  1,612  6,808  6,370  22,570 Interest on long-term debt (a) 17,204  1,433  2,613  2,024  11,134 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments     Purchase obligations and other (b) 1,843  1,710    Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) (f) 9,994   1,392  1,478  6,388 Total $ 70,909  $ 9,306  $ 11,128  $ 10,038  $ 40,437 36    |  2018 Form 10-K   (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2018 . Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018 . See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018 . (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million that AbbVie made to its principal domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2018 . Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of future funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension and other post-employment benefit plans. (d) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. (e) Includes $4.5 billion of contingent consideration liabilities primarily related to the acquisition of BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (f) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities. AbbVie enters into RD collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer.   2018 Form 10-K  |   37 Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $16.4 billion in 2018 , $12.9 billion in 2017 and $10.8 billion in 2016 . Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 91% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2018 . Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates  Managed Care Rebates  Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 1,032  $  $ Provisions 2,606  3,146  3,987 Payments (2,471 )  (2,899 )  (3,967 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 1,167  1,167  Provisions 2,909  3,990  5,026 Payments (2,736 )  (3,962 )  (4,887 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 1,340  1,195  Provisions 3,493  4,729  6,659 Payments (3,188 )  (4,485 )  (6,525 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,645  $ 1,439  $ Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2018 , $1.3 billion in 2017 and $964 million in 2016 , are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 38    |  2018 Form 10-K   The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2018 . A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 :  50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Defined benefit plans    Service and interest cost $ (54 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (512 )  Other post-employment plans    Service and interest cost $ (2 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (47 )  The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2019 by $62 million . The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 :  One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service and interest cost $  $ (9 ) Projected benefit obligation  (87 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum   2018 Form 10-K  |   39 loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPRD acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPRD acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent  Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2018 , a 50 basis point  increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately  $160 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2018 , a five percentage point  increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately  $420 million .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 :   (in millions) Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)  Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:            Euro $ 6,660  1.157  $  $ 6,366  1.175  $ (88 ) Japanese yen 1,076  111.5  (12 )   112.4  British pound  1.328    1.310  (22 ) All other currencies 1,776  n/a   1,877  n/a  (18 ) Total $ 10,011    $  $ 9,943    $ (126 ) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018 . If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $403 million at December 31, 2018 . If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.4 billion at December 31, 2018 . A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price Risk AbbVies debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVies policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVies investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $16 million as of December 31, 2018 . If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the statement of earnings in the period sold.   2018 Form 10-K  |   41 "," ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses.  In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients.  Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.  AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of  100%  of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.  Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. 48    |  2018 Form 10-K   In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 15 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (RD) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $1.1 billion in 2018 , $846 million in 2017 and $764 million in 2016 . Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five -year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of time deposits, marketable debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and equity securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-   2018 Form 10-K  |   49 maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie also considers industry factors and general market trends. When AbbVie determines that an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, the cost basis of the investment is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $51 million at December 31, 2018 and $58 million at December 31, 2017 . Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions)  Finished goods $  $ Work-in-process  Raw materials  Inventories $ 1,605  $ 1,605 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions)  Land $  $ Buildings 1,603  1,428 Equipment 6,362  5,991 Construction in progress  Property and equipment, gross 8,396  8,071 Less accumulated depreciation (5,513 )  (5,268 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,883  $ 2,803 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $471 million in 2018 , $425 million in 2017 and $425 million in 2016 . Assets related to capital leases were insignificant at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information 50    |  2018 Form 10-K   becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that r esults of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and  that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.  Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPRD projects acquired are expensed as IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPRD projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. RD costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are   2018 Form 10-K  |   51 remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2014-09 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) . The amendments in this standard superseded most existing revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017 have been presented in accordance with the standard, while results for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with AbbVies historical accounting. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. There were no significant changes to the amounts or timing of revenue recognition for product sales, the company's primary revenue stream. For certain licensing arrangements where revenue was previously deferred and recognized over time, revenue is now recognized at the point in time when the license is granted. Additionally, for certain contract manufacturing arrangements where revenue was previously recognized at a point in time at the end of the manufacturing process, revenue is now recognized over time throughout the manufacturing process. Under the new standard, on January 1, 2018, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings primarily related to certain deferred license revenues that were originally expected to be recognized through early 2020. The adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet included: (i) a $42 million increase to prepaid expenses and other; (ii) a $39 million decrease to inventories; (iii) a $57 million decrease to accounts payable and accrued liabilities; (iv) a $75 million decrease to other long-term liabilities; (v) a $22 million increase to deferred income taxes; and (vi) a $124 million increase to retained earnings. Other cumulative-effect adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. 52    |  2018 Form 10-K   The impact of adoption on the companys consolidated statements of earnings in 2018 was as follows: year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions, except per share data)  As Reported  Balances Without Adoption of ASU 2014-09  Effect of Change Higher/(Lower) Net revenues  $ 32,753  $ 32,812  $ (59 ) Cost of products sold  7,718  7,730  (12 ) Income tax benefit  (490 )  (487 )  (3 ) Net earnings  5,687  5,731  (44 ) Diluted earnings per share  $ 3.66  $ 3.69  $ (0.03 ) As of December 31, 2018 , due to the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, prepaid expenses and other were $40 million higher, inventories were $27 million lower, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $53 million lower, other long-term liabilities were $18 million lower, deferred income taxes were $11 million higher and retained earnings were $80 million higher on the companys consolidated balance sheet than they would have been had ASU 2014-09 not been adopted. Other impacts to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. ASU No. 2016-01 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption did not impact the accounting for AbbVie's investments in debt securities and did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-16 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The standard requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under previous U.S. GAAP, the income tax consequences of these intercompany asset transfers were deferred until the asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. As a result, on January 1, 2018, the company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheet that included a $1.9 billion decrease to retained earnings, a $1.4 billion decrease to prepaid expenses and other and a $0.5 billion decrease to other assets. ASU No. 2017-07 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . The standard requires that an employer continue to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item or items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately outside of income from operations and are not eligible for capitalization. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and applied the income statement classification provisions of this standard retrospectively. As a result, the company reclassified income of $47 million from operating earnings to non-operating income in 2017 and $44 million in 2016. Additionally, the company recorded approximately $34 million of non-operating income in 2018 which would have been recorded in operating earnings under the previous guidance. ASU No. 2017-12 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The standard simplifies the application of hedge accounting and more closely aligns the accounting with an entitys risk management activities. AbbVie elected to early adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.   2018 Form 10-K  |   53 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2016-02 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The standard outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model that supersedes the current lease guidance and requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. AbbVie has substantially completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2018. AbbVie will adopt the standard effective in the first quarter of 2019 and will not restate comparative periods upon adoption. AbbVie will elect a package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 and will not reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs capitalization for any existing leases. AbbVie does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of earnings. However, the new standard will require AbbVie to establish liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on its consolidated balance sheet of approximately $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion for operating leases that exist as of the adoption date. ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. Additionally, the standard requires new disclosures and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019 is permitted. With certain exceptions, adjustments are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach by reflecting adjustments through a cumulative-effect impact to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2018-02 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2019. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 54    |  2018 Form 10-K   Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information  Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions)   Interest expense $ 1,348  $ 1,150  $ 1,047 Interest income (204 )  (146 )  (82 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,144  $ 1,004  $ Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Sales rebates $ 3,939  $ 3,069 Dividends payable 1,607  1,143 Accounts payable 1,546  1,474 Salaries, wages and commissions  Royalty and license arrangements  Other 3,748  3,263 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 11,931  $ 10,226 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Income taxes payable $ 4,311  $ 4,675 Contingent consideration liabilities 4,306  4,266 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 2,726  2,683 Pension and other post-employment benefits 1,840  2,740 Other 1,307  1,241 Other long-term liabilities $ 14,490  $ 15,605 Note 4 Earnings Per Share  AbbVie grants certain restricted stock awards (RSAs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.   2018 Form 10-K  |   55 The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:  Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share information)   Basic EPS      Net earnings $ 5,687  $ 5,309  $ 5,953 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,657 $ 5,283 $ 5,923 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,541  1,596  1,622 Basic earnings per share $ 3.67  $ 3.31  $ 3.65       Diluted EPS      Net earnings $ 5,687  $ 5,309  $ 5,953 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,657  $ 5,283  $ 5,923 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,541  1,596  1,622 Effect of dilutive securities   Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,546  1,603  1,631 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.66  $ 3.30  $ 3.63 As further described in Note 12 , AbbVie entered into and executed an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with a third party financial institution in 2016. For purposes of calculating EPS, AbbVie reflected the ASR as a repurchase of AbbVie common stock. Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements  Acquisition of Stemcentrx On June 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Stemcentrx, a privately-held biotechnology company. The transaction expanded AbbVies oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer. The acquisition of Stemcentrx was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.  The aggregate upfront consideration for the acquisition of Stemcentrx consisted of approximately 62.4 million shares of AbbVie common stock, issued from common stock held in treasury, and cash. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development and regulatory milestones. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was $4.0 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $620 million and was estimated using a combination of probability-weighted discounted cash flow models and Monte Carlo simulation models. The estimate was determined based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, referred to as Level 3 inputs, as described in more detail in Note 10 . The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions)  Cash $ 1,883 Fair value of AbbVie common stock 3,923 Contingent consideration Total consideration $ 6,426 56    |  2018 Form 10-K   The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the June 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions)  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Accounts receivable $ Prepaid expenses and other Property and equipment Intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development 6,100 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (31 ) Deferred income taxes (1,933 ) Other long-term liabilities (7 ) Total identifiable net assets 4,154 Goodwill 2,272 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 6,426 Intangible assets were related to IPRD for Rova-T, four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and several additional pre-clinical compounds. The estimated fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated annual cash flows for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, RD costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, the regulatory approval probabilities, commercial success risks, competitive landscape as well as other factors. See Note 7 for additional information on the 2018 partial impairment of Stemcentrx-related intangible assets. The goodwill recognized represented expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) leverage the respective strengths of each business; (ii) expand the combined companys product portfolio; (iii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology; and (iv) establish a strong leadership position in oncology. Goodwill was also impacted by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Stemcentrx have been included in the company's financial statements. AbbVies consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 included no net revenues and an operating loss of $165 million associated with Stemcentrx's operations. This operating loss included $43 million of post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense for Stemcentrx options and excluded interest expense and certain acquisition costs. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of AbbVie and Stemcentrx for the year ended December 31, 2016 as if the acquisition of Stemcentrx had occurred on January 1, 2015: year ended December 31 (in millions, except per share information) Net revenues $ 25,641 Net earnings 5,907 Basic earnings per share $ 3.58 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.56 The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Stemcentrx. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2015 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition and the reclassification of acquisition, integration and financing-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31,   2018 Form 10-K  |   57 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of the future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition. Acquisition of BI 655066 and BI 655064 from Boehringer Ingelheim On April 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab (BI 655066), an anti-IL-23 monoclonal biologic antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, from Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. AbbVie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in other indications, including Crohns disease, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to risankizumab, AbbVie also gained rights to an anti-CD40 antibody, BI 655064, currently in Phase 1 development. BI will retain responsibility for further development of BI 655064, and AbbVie may elect to advance the program after completion of certain clinical achievements. The acquired assets include all patents, data, know-how, third-party agreements, regulatory filings and manufacturing technology related to BI 655066 and BI 655064. The company concluded that the acquired assets met the definition of a business and accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $595 million . Additionally, $18 million of payments to BI, pursuant to a contractual obligation to reimburse BI for certain development costs it incurred prior to the acquisition date, were initially deferred. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments based on net revenues of licensed products. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was approximately $1.6 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $606 million . The acquisition-date fair value of contingent royalty payments was $2.8 billion . The potential contingent consideration payments were estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which were then discounted to present value. The fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs. The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions)  Cash $ Deferred consideration payable Contingent consideration 3,365 Total consideration $ 3,978 The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired as of the April 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions)  Assets acquired  Identifiable intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development $ 3,890 Goodwill Total assets acquired $ 3,978 The estimated fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the income approach. The goodwill recognized represented expected synergies, including an expansion of the companys immunology product portfolio. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because this acquisition was insignificant to AbbVies consolidated results of operations. Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity Excluding the acquisitions above, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $736 million in 2018 , $308 million in 2017 and $262 million in 2016 . AbbVie recorded acquired IPRD charges of $424 million in 2018 , $327 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016 . Significant arrangements impacting 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. 58    |  2018 Form 10-K   Calico Life Sciences LLC In June 2018, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of a collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $500 million to the collaboration and the term is extended for an additional 3 years . Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2022 and will advance collaboration projects through Phase 2a through 2027. Following completion of Phase 2a, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license collaboration compounds. AbbVie will support Calico in its early research and development efforts and, upon exercise, would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During 2018 , AbbVie recorded $500 million in other expense in the consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement. Alector, Inc. In October 2017, AbbVie entered into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets and AbbVie has an option to global development and commercial rights to two targets. The terms of the arrangement included an initial upfront payment of $205 million , which was expensed to IPRD in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alector will conduct exploratory research, drug discovery and development for lead programs up to the conclusion of the proof of concept studies. If the option is exercised, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities and could make additional payments to Alector of up to $986 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Alector and AbbVie will co-fund development and commercialization and will share global profits equally. Other Arrangements In addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPRD of $424 million in 2018 , $122 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016 . In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2018 , AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $4.8 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Note 6 Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.  In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson  Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to IMBRUVICA, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs. In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of IMBRUVICA are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.   2018 Form 10-K  |   59 The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie: years ended December 31 (in millions)    United States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold)  $ 1,372  $ 1,001  $ International - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues)    Global - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items)    AbbVies receivable from Janssen, included in accounts receivable, net, was $177 million at December 31, 2018 and $124 million at December 31, 2017 . AbbVies payable to Janssen, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $376 million at December 31, 2018 and $253 million at December 31, 2017 . Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill: (in millions)  Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 15,416 Foreign currency translation Balance as of December 31, 2017 15,785 Foreign currency translation (122 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 15,663 The latest impairment assessment of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Future impairment tests for goodwill will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets:   as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount  Accumulated amortization  Net carrying amount  Gross carrying amount  Accumulated amortization  Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets            Developed product rights $ 15,872  $ (5,614 )  $ 10,258  $ 16,138  $ (4,982 )  $ 11,156 License agreements 7,865  (1,810 )  6,055  7,822  (1,409 )  6,413 Total definite-lived intangible assets 23,737  (7,424 )  16,313  23,960  (6,391 )  17,569 Indefinite-lived research and development 4,920    4,920  9,990    9,990 Total intangible assets, net $ 28,657  $ (7,424 )  $ 21,233  $ 33,950  $ (6,391 )  $ 27,559 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPRD associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. Indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. See Note 5 for additional information. The latest annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed in the third quarter of 2018 which supported that no impairment existed at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company made a decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating Rova-T as a second-line therapy for advanced small cell lung cancer following a recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This decision lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate for impairment the IPRD assets associated with the Stemcentrx acquisition. The company utilized multi-period excess earnings models of the income approach and determined that the current fair value was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 , which was lower than the carrying value of $6.1 billion and resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.1 billion ( $4.5 billion after 60    |  2018 Form 10-K   tax). The fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of the models included the estimated annual cash flows for each asset (including net revenues, cost of sales, RD costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, the regulatory approval probabilities, commercial success risks, competitive landscape as well as other factors. This impairment charge was recorded to RD expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 . AbbVie continues to evaluate information as it becomes available with respect to the Stemcentrx-related clinical development programs and will monitor the remaining IPRD assets for further impairment.  No indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2017 and 2016 . Future impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 2 to 16 years with an average of 11 years for both developed product rights and license agreements. Amortization expense was $1.3 billion in 2018 , $1.1 billion in 2017 and $764 million in 2016 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: (in billions)     Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 1.5  $ 1.7  $ 1.9  $ 2.1  $ 2.2 No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2018 . In 2017 , an impairment charge of $354 million was recorded related to ZINBRYTA that reduced both the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of the underlying intangible assets due to lower expected future cash flows for the product. In 2016 , an impairment charge of $39 million was recorded related to certain developed product rights in the United States due to a decline in the market for the product. The 2017 and 2016 impairment charges were based on discounted cash flow analyses and were included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. Note 8 Restructuring Plans  AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and RD operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $70 million in 2018 , $86 million in 2017 and $52 million in 2016 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded in cost of products sold, RD expense and SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or operations. The following table summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : (in millions)  Accrued balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 2016 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (113 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2016 2017 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (87 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2017 2018 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (46 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2018 $   2018 Form 10-K  |   61 Note 9 Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies  The following table summarizes long-term debt: as of December 31 (dollars in millions) Effective interest rate in 2018 (a)   Effective interest rate in 2017 (a)  Senior notes issued in 2012        2.00% notes due 2018 2.15 %  $   2.15 %  $ 1,000 2.90% notes due 2022 2.97 %  3,100  2.97 %  3,100 4.40% notes due 2042 4.46 %  2,600  4.46 %  2,600 Senior notes issued in 2015        1.80% notes due 2018 1.92 %    1.92 %  3,000 2.50% notes due 2020 2.65 %  3,750  2.65 %  3,750 3.20% notes due 2022 3.28 %  1,000  3.28 %  1,000 3.60% notes due 2025 3.66 %  3,750  3.66 %  3,750 4.50% notes due 2035 4.58 %  2,500  4.58 %  2,500 4.70% notes due 2045 4.73 %  2,700  4.73 %  2,700 Senior notes issued in 2016        2.30% notes due 2021 2.40 %  1,800  2.40 %  1,800 2.85% notes due 2023 2.91 %  1,000  2.91 %  1,000 3.20% notes due 2026 3.28 %  2,000  3.28 %  2,000 4.30% notes due 2036 4.37 %  1,000  4.37 %  1,000 4.45% notes due 2046 4.50 %  2,000  4.50 %  2,000 Senior Euro notes issued in 2016        0.38% notes due 2019 (1,400 principal) 0.55 %  1,604  0.55 %  1,673 1.38% notes due 2024 (1,450 principal) 1.46 %  1,661  1.46 %  1,733 2.13% notes due 2028 (750 principal) 2.18 %   2.18 %  Senior notes issued in 2018        3.375% notes due 2021 3.51 %  1,250   %   3.75% notes due 2023 3.84 %  1,250   %   4.25% notes due 2028 4.38 %  1,750   %   4.875% notes due 2048 4.94 %  1,750   %   Term loan facilities        Floating rate notes due 2018 3.06 %    2.26 %  2,000 Other    Fair value hedges   (466 )    (401 ) Unamortized bond discounts   (120 )    (97 ) Unamortized deferred financing costs   (163 )    (146 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations   36,611    36,968 Current portion   1,609    6,015 Noncurrent portion   $ 35,002    $ 30,953 (a) Excludes the effect of any related interest rate swaps. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2021, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2023, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2028 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2048. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and 62    |  2018 Form 10-K   unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium, and except for the 3.375% notes due 2021, AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $37 million and debt discounts totaled $37 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three -year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. The company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay term loan obligations in 2019 as they become due. In May 2018, the company also repaid $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and three months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $17 million and debt discounts totaled $9 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. As a result of this redemption, the company incurred a charge of $39 million ( $25 million after tax) related to the make-whole premium, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses. The charge was recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $52 million and debt discounts totaled $29 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Of the $7.7 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the companys outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion was used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion was used to finance an ASR with a third party financial institution. See Note 5 for additional information related to the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. In connection with the May 2016 unsecured senior notes issuance, AbbVie repaid a $2.0 billion  364 -day term loan credit agreement. AbbVie has outstanding $13.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2015. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes, at any time, prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium and AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. AbbVie has outstanding $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2012. AbbVie may redeem all of the senior notes of each series, at any time, or some of the senior notes of each series, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with its senior note covenants and term loan covenants. Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings included commercial paper borrowings of $699 million at December 31, 2018 and $400 million at December 31, 2017 . The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 2.0% in 2018 , 1.3% in 2017 and 0.6% in 2016 . In August 2018, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion  five -year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2023. The new facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . In May 2018 , AbbVie entered into a $3.0 billion  364 -day term loan credit agreement (term loan). In June 2018, the company drew on this term loan and as of December 31, 2018 , $3.0 billion was outstanding and was included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at one month LIBOR plus   2018 Form 10-K  |   63 applicable margin. The term loan may be prepaid without penalty upon prior notice and contains customary covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2018 . Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, debt maturities and future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 : as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) Operating leases  Debt maturities and capital leases $  $ 1,612 105  3,755 100  3,053 81  4,120 64  2,250 Thereafter  22,570 Total obligations and commitments  37,360 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond discounts and deferred financing costs  (749 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations $  $ 36,611 Lease expense was $161 million in 2018 , $169 million in 2017 and $159 million in 2016 . AbbVie's operating leases generally include renewal options and provide for the company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs of the leased property. As of December 31, 2018 , annual future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations were insignificant. Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 10 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures  Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months . Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. 64    |  2018 Form 10-K   The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2017 . The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes and designated the principal amounts of this foreign denominated debt as net investment hedges. Concurrently, the company settled foreign currency forward exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of 3.5 billion that were designated as net investment hedges. AbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $10.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $11.8 billion at December 31, 2017 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges.

The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities were determined based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using published spot curves for interest rate hedges and published forward curves for foreign currency contracts. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2018 , a 50 basis point  increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately  $160 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2018 , a five percentage point  increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately  $420 million . There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions)   Beginning balance $ 4,534  $ 4,213  $  Additions (See Note 5)     3,985 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings   Milestone payments (100 )  (305 )   Ending balance $ 4,483  $ 4,534  $ 4,213 The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval.   2018 Form 10-K  |   67 Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

Net realized gains and losses were insignificant in 2018 and 2016 . Net realized gains in 2017 were $90 million . Concentrations of Risk The company invests excess cash in time deposits, money market funds and debt securities to diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. The company has established credit exposure limits and monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institution deposits. The functional currency of the company's Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the Divisa Complementaria (DICOM) rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , AbbVies net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 63% as of December 31, 2018 and 56% as of December 31, 2017 , and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 61% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 , 65% in 2017 and 63% in 2016 . Note 11 Post-Employment Benefits  AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 .   2018 Form 10-K  |   69 The following table summarizes benefit plan information for the global AbbVie-sponsored defined benefit and other post-employment plans:  Defined benefit plans  Other post-employment plans as of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions)    Projected benefit obligations        Beginning of period $ 6,985  $ 5,829  $  $ Service cost    Interest cost    Employee contributions      Actuarial (gain) loss (614 )   (287 )  Benefits paid (191 )  (173 )  (16 )  (15 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments (76 )     End of period 6,618  6,985   Fair value of plan assets        Beginning of period 5,399  4,572     Actual return on plan assets (384 )      Company contributions    Employee contributions      Benefits paid (191 )  (173 )  (16 )  (15 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments (62 )      End of period 5,637  5,399     Funded status, end of period $ (981 )  $ (1,586 )  $ (561 )  $ (813 )         Amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets        Other assets $  $  $   $  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (8 )  (32 )  (15 )  (15 ) Other long-term liabilities (1,294 )  (1,942 )  (546 )  (798 ) Net obligation $ (981 )  $ (1,586 )  $ (561 )  $ (813 ) Actuarial loss, net $ 2,516  $ 2,471  $  $ Prior service cost (credit)   (22 )  (29 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 2,527  $ 2,483  $  $ The projected benefit obligations (PBO) in the table above included $1.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 , related to international defined benefit plans.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% in 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2018 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 7.7% pre-65 ( 9.5% post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% for 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2018 , a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:  One percentage point year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service cost and interest cost $  $ (10 ) Projected benefit obligation  (87 ) Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets    Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)     Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)     Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 2,359  $ 1,586  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 3,278       Fair value of plan assets $ 5,637    72    |  2018 Form 10-K      Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)     Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)     Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 1,715  $ 1,208  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 3,684       Fair value of plan assets $ 5,399    (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The target investment allocations for the AbbVie Pension Plan is 35% in equity securities, 20% in fixed income securities and 45% in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.   2018 Form 10-K  |   73 Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans  Other post-employment plans $  $ 2020  2021  2022  2023  2024 to 2028 1,589  Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plan is the AbbVie Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $89 million in 2018 , $82 million in 2017 and $75 million in 2016 related to this plan. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 12 Equity  Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least ten years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows:  Years ended December 31, (in millions)   Cost of products sold $  $  $ Research and development   Selling, general and administrative   Pre-tax compensation expense   Tax benefit   After-tax compensation expense $  $  $ Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $78 million in 2018 , $71 million in 2017 and $55 million in 2016 . Since 2017, all excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards have been recognized in the statement of earnings when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders' equity as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. 74    |  2018 Form 10-K   Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100% of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $21.63 in 2018 , $9.80 in 2017 and $9.29 in 2016 . The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2018 : (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options  Weighted- average exercise price  Weighted- average remaining life (in years)  Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2017 8,316  $ 41.69  5.1  $ Granted  114.36     Exercised (2,781 )  28.75     Lapsed (26 )  17.03     Outstanding at December 31, 2018 6,143  $ 55.05  6.2  $ Exercisable at December 31, 2018 4,293  $ 45.23  5.3  $ The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $215 million in 2018 , $371 million in 2017 and $325 million in 2016 . The total fair value of options vested during 2018 was $22 million . As of December 31, 2018 , $6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSAs, RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Such awards granted before 2016 consisted of RSAs or RSUs for which vesting was contingent upon AbbVie achieving a minimum annual return on equity (ROE). Since 2016, equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three -year performance period based on AbbVies ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three -year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVies EPS achievement and AbbVies total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs, RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVies common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie's remaining share repurchase authorization was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018 , approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 and approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 . Additionally, in 2016 , AbbVie executed an ASR in connection with the Stemcentrx acquisition and repurchased approximately 60 million shares for $3.8 billion . 76    |  2018 Form 10-K   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments  Net investment hedging activities  Pension and post- employment benefits  Marketable security activities  Cash flow hedging activities  Total Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ (1,270 )  $   $ (1,378 )  $  $  $ (2,561 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (165 )   (194 )    (52 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss      (8 )  (24 )  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) (165 )   (135 )  (1 )   (25 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 (1,435 )   (1,513 )    (2,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications  (343 )  (480 )   (230 )  (344 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss     (75 )  (112 )  Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)  (343 )  (406 )  (46 )  (342 )  (141 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 (439 )  (203 )  (1,919 )    (166 )  (2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (391 )    (14 )   (27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss        Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) (391 )    (10 )   Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ (830 )  $ (65 )  $ (1,722 )  $ (10 )  $  $ (2,480 ) Other comprehensive loss in 2018 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $391 million , which was principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. In 2017, AbbVie reclassified $316 million of historical currency translation losses from AOCI related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. These losses were included in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statement of earnings and had no related income tax impacts. Other comprehensive loss in 2017 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $680 million , which was principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss in 2016 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $165 million , which was principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets.   2018 Form 10-K  |   77 The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains)   Pension and post-employment benefits      Amortization of actuarial losses and other (a) $  $  $ Tax benefit (28 )  (33 )  (26 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $  $  $       Cash flow hedging activities      Losses (gains) on designated cash flow hedges (b) $  $ (118 )  $ (20 ) Tax expense (benefit) (4 )   (4 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $  $ (112 )  $ (24 ) (a) Amounts are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 11 ).

The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. These changes were generally effective for tax years beginning in 2018. 78    |  2018 Form 10-K   The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The taxability of the foreign earnings and the applicable tax rates are dependent on future events. The companys accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. Additionally, the Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Acts transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings and the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. As such, the company records foreign withholding tax liabilities related to the future cash repatriation of such earnings. However, the company considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. Prior to the enactment of the Act, the company did not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Due to the provision of the Act that required a one-time deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, in 2017, the company recorded a transition tax expense of $4.5 billion . The company also recognized income tax expense of $338 million related to transition tax on income from the sale of inventory in 2018. The transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. Additionally, in 2017, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future. In 2017, the net tax benefit of U.S. tax reform from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes was $3.6 billion . Given the complexity of the Act and anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the enactment date of the Act. As a result, in 2017, the companys analysis and accounting for the tax effects of the Act was preliminary. In 2017, as a direct result of the Act, the company recorded $4.5 billion of transition tax expense, as well as $4.1 billion of net tax benefit for deferred tax remeasurement. Both of these amounts were provisional estimates, as the company had not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax or its analysis of certain other aspects of the Act that impacted the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. In 2018, the company finalized its provisional estimates and recognized income tax expense related to the Act of $86 million , which primarily related to the transition tax expense on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation years ended December 31   Statutory tax rate 21.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % Effect of foreign operations (28.7 )  (12.2 )  (10.3 ) U.S. tax credits (7.3 )  (4.0 )  (4.4 ) Impacts related to U.S. tax reform 8.2  12.0   Tax law change related to foreign currency     2.4 Stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (1.5 )  (0.9 )   Tax audit settlements (2.5 )  (1.2 )   All other, net 1.4  2.6  1.8 Effective tax rate (9.4 )%  31.3 %  24.5 % The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law, acquisitions and collaborations. The effective income tax rates in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to changes in enacted tax rates and laws, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, the cost of repatriation decisions and Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.   2018 Form 10-K  |   79 The effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. Specific to 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. The 2018 effective income tax rate also reflects the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. In addition, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $131 million in 2018 and $91 million in 2017 related to the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. The effective income tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations.

The state tax carryforwards expire between 2019 and 2038. As of December 31, 2018 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $427 million . Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $350 million expire between 2020 and 2028 and the remaining do not have an expiration period. The company had valuation allowances of $103 million as of December 31, 2018 and $108 million as of December 31, 2017 . These were principally related to state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Current income taxes receivable were $488 million as of December 31, 2018 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and were included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets.

AbbVie will be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $2.7 billion in 2018 and $2.6 billion in 2017 . Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2018 , AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $84 million . The Increase due to current year tax positions in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. The ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above includes amounts relating to federal, state and international items as well as prior positions acquired through business development activities during the year. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $73 million in 2018 , $24 million in 2017 and $35 million in 2016 , for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $190 million at December 31, 2018 , $120 million at December 31, 2017 and $112 million at December 31, 2016 . The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months up to $486 million . All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2010. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 14 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2018 and approximately $445 million as of December 31, 2017 . Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Several pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvay's patent litigation involving AndroGel was sham litigation and the 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. These cases include: (a) four individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) three purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. et al. Following the district court's dismissal of all plaintiffs' claims, appellate proceedings led to the reinstatement of the claims regarding the patent litigation settlements, which are proceeding in the district court. In July 2018, the court denied the private plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits   2018 Form 10-K  |   81 consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by three named direct purchasers of Niaspan and the other brought by ten named end-payer purchasers of Niaspan. The cases are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorneys Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys fees. In May 2018, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the District Attorneys Office may not bring monetary claims beyond the scope of Orange County. In September 2014, the FTC filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTCs settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $448 million , plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTCs request for injunctive relief. AbbVie is appealing the courts liability and disgorgement rulings and, based on an assessment of the merits of that appeal, no liability has been accrued for this matter. The FTC is also appealing aspects of the courts trial ruling and the dismissal of its settlement-related claim. In July and August 2018, several direct AndroGel purchasers brought two individual and one class action cases in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging sham litigation based on the courts trial ruling in the FTCs case. Those cases are stayed pending the appeals in the FTCs case. In March 2015, the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit, State of Louisiana v. Fournier Industrie et Sante, et al. , against AbbVie, Abbott and affiliated Abbott entities in Louisiana state court. Plaintiff alleges that patent applications and patent litigation filed and other alleged conduct from the early 2000's and before related to the drug TriCor violated Louisiana State antitrust and unfair trade practices laws. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and attorneys' fees. Plaintiff has filed a writ of certiorari with the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking to appeal the August 2018 dismissal of this lawsuit by the Louisiana Court of Appeal. In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payers who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted include violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In July 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 4,000 claims are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 200 claims against AbbVie are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Six cases have gone to trial. Four of those have resulted in complete verdicts for AbbVie: three by juries in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in January, May, and June 2018, and one by a jury in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court in August 2017. Another case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois resulted in a March 2018 jury verdict for AbbVie on strict liability and fraud and for the plaintiff on negligence and awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages, which is the subject of post-trial proceedings. Another case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois resulted in a jury verdict for AbbVie on strict liability and for the plaintiff on remaining claims and an award of $140,000 in compensatory damages and $140 million in punitive damages in August 2017. In July 2018, the court vacated that verdict and ordered a new trial. In November 2018, AbbVie entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee in the MDL encompassing all existing claims in all courts. All proceedings in pending cases are effectively stayed, including post-trial proceedings in cases that had been tried to verdict with appellate rights preserved. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Approximately 404 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and approximately six others are pending in various other federal and state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Over ninety percent of these pending cases, plus other unfiled claims, are subject to confidential settlement agreements and are expected to be dismissed with prejudice. To date, approximately 185 cases have been dismissed with prejudice. In November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit, Rubinstein, et al. v Gonzalez, et al. , on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc (Shire) securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made 82    |  2018 Form 10-K   and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie's proposed transaction with Shire. In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2018 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In May 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Ellis v. Gonzalez, et al. , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that AbbVie's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with statements made regarding the Shire transaction. The lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory damages for AbbVie, among other relief. In July 2018, the court dismissed this case with prejudice. In August 2018, plaintiff appealed that dismissal to the Delaware Supreme Court. In September 2018, the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance intervened in a qui tam lawsuit, State of California and Lazaro Suarez v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , brought under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, in California Superior Court for Alameda County. The Department of Insurances complaint alleges that, through patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value provided in connection with HUMIRA, AbbVie caused the submission of fraudulent commercial insurance claims for HUMIRA in violation of the California statute. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an assessment of up to three times the amount of the claims at issue, and civil penalties. In addition, two federal securities lawsuits were filed in September ( Pippins v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in the United States District Court for the Central District of California) and October ( Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and then-chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for HUMIRA sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted the conduct alleged in the Department of Insurances complaint. In November 2018, the Pippins case was voluntarily dismissed. Beginning in May 2016, the Patent Trial  Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent  Trademark Office (PTO) instituted five inter partes review proceedings brought by Coherus Biosciences and Boehringer Ingelheim related to three AbbVie patents covering methods of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis using adalimumab. In these proceedings, the PTO reviewed the validity of the patents and issued decisions of invalidity in May, June and July of 2017. AbbVies appeal of the decisions is pending in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, AbbVie filed a lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. v. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. and Grifols Worldwide Operations Ltd. , in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Novartis Vaccines and Grifols Worldwide seeking a declaratory judgment that eleven HCV-related patents licensed to AbbVie in 2002 are invalid. AbbVie is seeking to enforce certain patent rights related to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark HUMIRA). In a case filed in United States District Court for the District of Delaware in August 2017, AbbVie alleges that Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbHs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical, Inc.s, and Boehringer Ingelheim Fremont, Inc.s proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents. AbbVie seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib capsules (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark IMBRUVICA). In February 2018, four separate cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the following defendants: Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc., and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Limited; Shilpa Medicare Limited, Sun Pharma Global FZE and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Cipla Limited and Cipla USA Inc.; and Zydus Worldwide DMCC, Cadila Healthcare Limited, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Sandoz Inc., and Lek Pharmaceuticals D.D. In November 2018, Pharmacyclics filed a fifth suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Hetero USA Inc., Hetero Labs Limited and Hetero Labs Limited Unit-I and Unit-V. In each case, Pharmacyclics alleges the defendants proposed generic ibrutinib product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of IMBRUVICA, is the co-plaintiff in these suits.   2018 Form 10-K  |   83 Note 15 Segment and Geographic Area Information  AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the income tax consequences of intercompany transfers of assets other than inventory in 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 27, 2019  88    |  2018 Form 10-K   "," ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 . Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 .   2018 Form 10-K  |   89 Report of independent registered public accounting firm.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 27, 2019    2018 Form 10-K  |   91 "

Segments AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the sales information related to HUMIRA included under Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations."" Products AbbVie's portfolio of products includes a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. HUMIRA. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is a biologic therapy administered as a subcutaneous injection. It is approved to treat the following autoimmune diseases in the United States, Canada and Mexico (collectively, North America) and in the European Union: Condition  Principal Markets Rheumatoid arthritis (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Psoriatic arthritis  North America, European Union Ankylosing spondylitis  North America, European Union Adult Crohn's disease (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Plaque psoriasis (moderate to severe chronic)  North America, European Union Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (moderate to severe polyarticular)  North America, European Union Ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Axial spondyloarthropathy  European Union Pediatric Crohn's disease (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Hidradenitis Suppurativa (moderate to severe)  North America, European Union Pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis  European Union Non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis  North America, European Union HUMIRA is also approved in Japan for the treatment of intestinal Behet's disease.

AbbVie continues to work on HUMIRA formulation and delivery enhancements to improve convenience and the overall patient experience. _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms ""AbbVie"" or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.   2017 Form 10-K  |   1 Oncology products.  AbbVies oncology products target some of the most complex and difficult-to-treat cancers. These products are:  IMBRUVICA.  IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily therapy that inhibits a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive an FDA approval after being granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and IMBRUVICA is one of the few therapies to receive four separate designations. IMBRUVICA currently is approved for the treatment of adult patients with:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL/SLL with 17p deletion;  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy*;  Waldenstrms macroglobulinemia (WM);  Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy*; and  Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. _______________________________________________________________________________ * Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. VENCLEXTA.  VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) is approved to treat people with CLL with 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior treatment. VENCLEXTA is the first FDA-approved treatment that targets the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients with CLL. VENCLEXTA has been approved in the EU for the treatment of CLL in patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation and are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor and for the treatment of CLL in absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.  Virology Products. AbbVie's virology products address unmet needs for patients living with HCV and HIV-1. HCV products. AbbVie's HCV products are: VIEKIRA PAK AND TECHNIVIE. VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) is an all-oral, short-course, interferon-free therapy, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, including those with compensated cirrhosis. In Europe, VIEKIRA PAK is marketed as VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA and is approved for use in patients with genotype 1 and genotype 4 HCV. AbbVie's TECHNIVIE (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) is FDA-approved for use in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of adults with genotype 4 HCV infection in the United States. MAVYRET/MAVIRET. MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (MAVIRET) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. Additional Virology products. AbbVie's additional virology products include: KALETRA. KALETRA (lopinavir/ritonavir), which is also marketed as Aluvia in emerging markets, is a prescription anti-HIV-1 medicine that contains two protease inhibitors: lopinavir and ritonavir. KALETRA is used with other anti-HIV-1 medications as a treatment that maintains viral suppression in people with HIV-1. NORVIR. NORVIR (ritonavir) is a protease inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. SYNAGIS. SYNAGIS (palivizumab) is a product marketed by AbbVie outside of the United States that protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease caused by RSV. 2    |  2017 Form 10-K   Metabolics/Hormones products. Metabolic and hormone products target a number of conditions, including testosterone deficiency due to certain underlying conditions, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism. These products include: AndroGel. AndroGel (testosterone gel) is a testosterone replacement therapy for males diagnosed with symptomatic low testosterone due to certain underlying conditions that is available in two strengths: 1 percent and 1.62 percent. CREON. CREON (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AbbVie has the rights to sell AndroGel, CREON and Synthroid only in the United States. Endocrinology products. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and LUPRON DEPOT, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection. Other products. AbbVie's other products include: Duopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa). AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States. Anesthesia products. Sevoflurane (sold under the trademarks Ultane and Sevorane) is an anesthesia product that AbbVie sells worldwide for human use. ZINBRYTA. ZINBRYTA (daclizumab) is a once-monthly, self-administered, subcutaneous treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), which was approved by the FDA in May 2016 and by the European Commission in July 2016. Due to the risk of serious liver damage, the use of ZINBRYTA is restricted to adult patients with relapsing forms of MS who have had an inadequate response to at least two disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and for whom treatment with any other DMT is contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States all of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and country regulatory bodies. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. In 2017 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42% of AbbVie's 2017 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. These wholesalers purchase product from AbbVie under standard terms and conditions of sale. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's   2017 Form 10-K  |   3 business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with other available HCV treatment options. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVies competitors could cause revenues for AbbVies products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVies biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The advent of biologics has also raised complex regulatory issues and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns because the cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and because many expensive biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products, as are significant investments in marketing, distribution, and sales organization activities, which may limit the number of biosimilar competitors. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the Public Health Service Act, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for, and science behind, generic or other follow-on versions of small molecule products. This added complexity is due to steps needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic, such as HUMIRA. Ultimate approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. The law also requires that the biosimilar must be for a condition of use approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe, pure and potent. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty. In the European Union, while a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005, the products that have come to market to date have had a mixed impact on the market share of incumbent products, with significant variation by product. Other Competitive Products. Although a number of competitive biologic branded products have been approved since HUMIRA was first introduced in 2003, most have gained only a modest share of the worldwide market. AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVies intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are 4    |  2017 Form 10-K   often obtained early in the development process, and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a patent term restoration, for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDAs reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days the longest existing exclusivity (patent or regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of follow-on biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents, and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2018 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVies business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark HUMIRA), are material in relation to the companys business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent is expected to expire in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark IMBRUVICA), those related to ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (which are sold under the trademarks VIEKIRA PAK, VIEKIRAX, EXVIERA, and HOLKIRA PAK), those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (which are sold under the trademarks MAVYRET and MAVIRET), and those related to testosterone (which is sold under the trademark AndroGel). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States   2017 Form 10-K  |   5 composition of matter patents covering ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in 2032, 2031 and 2029, respectively. The United States composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVies trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVies employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. These licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVies existing portfolio. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:  Phase 1involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing.  Phase 2tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients. 6    |  2017 Form 10-K    Phase 3tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. AbbVie spent approximately $5.0 billion in 2017 , $4.4 billion in 2016 and $4.3 billion in 2015 on research to discover and develop new products, indications and processes and to improve existing products and processes. These expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, license fees, consulting payments, contract research, clinical drug supply manufacturing, the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities, clinical trial costs and collaboration fees and expenses. RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA or BLA, and approved by the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials or patient registries, or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application.   2017 Form 10-K  |   7 The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). RegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under 8    |  2017 Form 10-K   Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2018 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. AbbVie is subject to a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) entered into by Abbott on May 7, 2012 that requires enhancements to AbbVie's compliance program and contains reporting obligations, including disclosure of financial payments to doctors. If AbbVie fails to comply with the CIA, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services may impose monetary penalties or exclude AbbVie from federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United   2017 Form 10-K  |   9 States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2017 were approximately $17 million and operating expenditures were approximately $28 million . In 2018 , capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $3 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $30 million . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 29,000 persons as of January 31, 2018. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). "," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. 10    |  2017 Form 10-K   Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1 , "" Business Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3 , "" Legal Proceedings ."" The United States composition of matter patent for HUMIRA, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $18.4 billion in 2017 , expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent is expected to expire in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. Because HUMIRA is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted, it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of HUMIRA.  AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.  A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction   2017 Form 10-K  |   11 preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.  Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. HUMIRA accounted for approximately 65% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2017 . Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for HUMIRA, the commercialization of biosimilars of HUMIRA, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of HUMIRA for any reason.  AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.  A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. For example, AbbVie is collaborating with Roche Holding AG to develop and commercialize a next-generation Bcl-2 inhibitor, Venclexta (venetoclax), for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and AbbVie is investigating its efficacy for additional indications. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. 12    |  2017 Form 10-K    Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologicsincluding HUMIRAcould adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.  AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with AbbVies biologic products. As competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVies biologic products, AbbVies products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVies applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products.  New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market, and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVies virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVies products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVies products, and this could negatively impact AbbVies business and results of operations.  The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.   2017 Form 10-K  |   13  AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier.  Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products.  AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured.  AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""BusinessRegulationCommercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing 14    |  2017 Form 10-K   changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.  AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1 , "" Business RegulationDiscovery and Clinical Development."" The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.  AbbVie could be subject to increased monetary penalties and/or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal health care programs, if it fails to comply with the terms of the May 7, 2012 resolution of the Department of Justice's investigation into sales and marketing activities for Depakote. On May 7, 2012, Abbott settled United States federal and 49 state investigations into its sales and marketing activities for Depakote by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, agreeing to pay   2017 Form 10-K  |   15 approximately $700 million in criminal fines and forfeitures and approximately $900 million to resolve civil claims, and submitting to a term of probation. The term of probation ended January 1, 2016 upon AbbVie satisfying all of the probation conditions. However, if AbbVie violates any remaining terms of the plea agreement, it may face additional monetary sanctions and other such remedies as the court deems appropriate. In addition, Abbott entered into a five-year CIA with the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). The effective date of the CIA is October 11, 2012. The obligations of the CIA have transferred to and become fully binding on AbbVie. The CIA requires enhancements to AbbVie's compliance program, fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligations, management certifications and resolutions from AbbVie's board of directors, among other requirements. Compliance with the requirements of the settlement will impose additional costs and burdens on AbbVie, including in the form of employee training, third party reviews, compliance monitoring, reporting obligations and management attention. If AbbVie fails to comply with the CIA, the OIG may impose monetary penalties or exclude AbbVie from federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. AbbVie and Abbott may be subject to third party claims and shareholder lawsuits in connection with the settlement, and AbbVie may be required to indemnify all or a portion of Abbott's costs.  The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States make up approximately 35% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2017 . The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;  multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;  differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action;  inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;  potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability.  If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient for IMBRUVICA and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers IMBRUVICA to AbbVie's customers. The commercialization of 16    |  2017 Form 10-K   IMBRUVICA may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indications, the relative price of IMBRUVICA as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to the label for IMBRUVICA that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of IMBRUVICA is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with Pharmacyclics will be adversely affected.  AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.  AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2017 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.  AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness, these risks could increase. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt.  AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business.   2017 Form 10-K  |   17  AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:  changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;  changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and  changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock  AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 , "" Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.  An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions, or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. 18    |  2017 Form 10-K   In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.  Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:  the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;  the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;  the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and  the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.   2017 Form 10-K  |   19 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 . This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neurology, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 29,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products. 2017 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2017 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $28.2 billion , operating earnings of $9.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.30 . Worldwide net revenues grew by 10% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA, revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and other key products including Creon and Duodopa and the launch of HCV product MAVYRET. These increases were partially offset by a decline in net revenues of HCV product VIEKIRA. Diluted earnings per share in 2017 was $3.30 and included net charges related to the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . The net charges included $4.5 billion for the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries , partially offset by after-tax benefits of $3.3 billion due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and other related impacts . Additional after-tax costs that impacted 2017 diluted earnings per share included the following: (i) $809 million related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $625 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $327 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPRD); (iv) litigation reserve charges of $286 million ; (v) an intangible asset impairment charge of $244 million ; (vi) milestone payments of $143 million ; and (vii) acquisition related costs of $49 million . These costs were partially offset by an after-tax benefit of $91 million due to a tax audit settlement. 2017 financial results also reflected continued added funding to support AbbVies emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVies growth brands. In 2017 , the company generated cash flows from operations of $10.0 billion , which AbbVie utilized to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to stockholders of $4.1 billion and repurchase approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in the open market. In October 2017 , AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per share of common stock payable in February 2018 . This reflected an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of common stock. 28    |  2017 Form 10-K   2018 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (ii) continued investment and expansion in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neurology as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:  HUMIRA sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories, maintaining market leadership and effectively managing biosimilar erosion.  IMBRUVICA revenue growth driven by increasing market share with its eight currently approved indications in six different disease areas.  The strong execution of new product launches, including MAVYRET.  The favorable impact of pipeline products approved in 2017 or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2018. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7 . AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neurology along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Upadacitinib  In June 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-NEXT clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib (ABT-494), the companys selective JAK1 inhibitor currently in late-stage development for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond to treatment with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 trials and no new safety signals were detected.  In September 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-BEYOND clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond or were intolerant to treatment with biologic DMARDs. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 trials and the Phase 3 SELECT-NEXT clinical trial, with no new safety signals detected.   2017 Form 10-K  |   29  In December 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-MONOTHERAPY clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond to treatment with methotrexate. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 3 SELECT clinical trials and Phase 2 trials, with no new safety signals detected.  In 2017, AbbVie initiated Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohns disease and in subjects with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis.  In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for upadacitinib in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Risankizumab  In October 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, with 12-week dosing compared to ustekinumab and adalimumab met all co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the three studies.  In December 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 IMMhance clinical trial evaluating risankizumab at 16 weeks and 52 weeks of treatment compared to placebo met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported Phase 3 studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the Phase 3 program.  In December 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohns disease. Oncology IMBRUVICA  In January 2017, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. MZL is a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  In August 2017, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. IMBRUVICA is the first therapy specifically approved for adults with cGVHD, a severe and potentially life-threatening consequence of stem cell or bone marrow transplant. This marked the sixth U.S. disease indication for IMBRUVICA since the medication's initial approval in 2013 and the first approved indication outside of cancer.  In December 2017, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 iNNOVATE clinical trial evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab in patients with untreated (treatment-nave) and previously-treated Waldenstrms macroglobulinemia (WM) met its primary endpoint. This is the first and only treatment approved for newly or previously-treated patients with WM. VENCLEXTA  In February 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in treatment-nave elderly subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard induction therapy (high-dose chemotherapy). 30    |  2017 Form 10-K    In May 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) improves overall survival (OS) versus LDAC and placebo, in treatment nave subjects with AML.  In September 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 MURANO clinical trial evaluating venetoclax tablets in combination with Rituxan (rituximab) met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with bendamustine in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  In December 2017, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and in January 2018, AbbVie submitted an sNDA for VENCLEXTA monotherapy in patients with CLL who have relapsed or are refractory to B-cell receptor inhibitors. Rova-T  In February 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum based chemotherapy in participants with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  In April 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate Rova-T compared with topotecan for subjects with advanced or metastatic SCLC with high levels of delta-like protein 3 who have first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy. ABT-414  In November 2017, AbbVie presented results from the INTELLANCE-2 trial, a potential registration-enabling Phase 2 study evaluating depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414), an investigational, antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alone or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Results from the INTELLANCE-2 study failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival and AbbVie will not be submitting regulatory applications for ABT-414 in recurrent GBM. In INTELLANCE-2, the combination of ABT-414 and TMZ performed numerically better than lomustine or TMZ and a positive trend in overall survival was observed. While AbbVie will not file in recurrent GBM based on these data, the Phase 2/3 INTELLANCE-1 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ABT-414 in combination with TMZ in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM with EGFR amplification is ongoing. Veliparib  In April 2017, AbbVie announced that two Phase 3 studies evaluating veliparib, an investigational, oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy did not meet their primary endpoints. The studies evaluated veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Ongoing Phase 3 studies include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, BRCA1/2 breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Virology/Liver Disease  In February 2017, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for a shorter, eight-week treatment of VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets) as an option for previously untreated adult patients with genotype 1b chronic HCV and minimal to moderate fibrosis.  In July 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), a once-daily, ribavirin-free treatment for adults with HCV infection across all major genotypes (GT1-6). MAVIRET is also indicated for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those with compensated cirrhosis across all major genotypes, and those who previously had limited treatment options, such as patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV infection.  In August 2017, the FDA approved MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). MAVYRET is also   2017 Form 10-K  |   31 indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. Other  In September 2017, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for elagolix, an investigational, orally administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, being evaluated for the management of endometriosis with associated pain. In October, AbbVie was granted priority review for elagolix by the FDA for the management of endometriosis with associated pain. In November, AbbVie announced detailed results from two replicate Phase 3 extension studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix, being evaluated for the management of endometriosis with associated pain.  In December 2017, AbbVie announced the strategic decision to close the SONAR study, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effects of the investigational compound atrasentan on progression of kidney disease in patients with stage 2 to 4 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes when added to standard of care. The ongoing monitoring of renal events observed in the study revealed considerably fewer endpoints than expected at the time of analysis, which will likely affect the ability to test the SONAR study hypothesis. Therefore, AbbVie determined that it cannot justify continuing the participation of patients in the study. The decision to close the SONAR study early was not related to any safety concerns. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales increased 14% in 2017 and 16% in 2016 . The sales increases in 2017 and 2016 were driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. The sales increase in 2016 was also driven by the approval of new indications. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 18% in 2017 and 24% in 2016 . The sales increase in 2017 was driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. The sales increase in 2016 was driven by market growth across all indications, higher market share and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 7% in 2017 and 4% in 2016 , driven primarily by market growth across indications. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA commenced following the completion of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, 2015. Global IMBRUVICA sales increased 40% in 2017 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. The sales increase in 2016 was driven by market share gains following the FDA and EMA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as having a full year of sales in 2016. Global HCV sales decreased 16% in 2017 and 6% in 2016 . The sales decrease in 2017 and 2016 was a result of market contraction, lower market share and price erosion of VIEKIRA. These factors were partially offset for 2017 by the launch of MAVYRET in certain geographies during the second half of 2017. Net revenues for Creon increased 14% in 2017 and 15% in 2016 , driven primarily by continued market growth and higher market share. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. Global Kaletra net revenues decreased 25% in 2017 and 17% in 2016 , primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the HIV marketplace. AbbVie expects net revenues for Kaletra to continue to decline in 2018 . Net revenues for Duodopa increased 20% in 2017 and 28% in 2016 , primarily as a result of market penetration and geographic expansion.

These drivers were partially offset by lower amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics as well as favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization, the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement and higher amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics. Additionally, 2016 gross margin included an intangible asset impairment charge of $39 million and 2015 gross margin included milestone revenue of $40 million from an oncology collaboration partner. These drivers were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies. 34    |  2017 Form 10-K   Selling, General and Administrative        Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2016 2017 Selling, general and administrative $ 6,275  $ 5,855  $ 6,387  %  (8 )% as a percent of net revenues %  %  %     SGA expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 due to continued leverage from revenue growth partially offset by litigation reserve charges of $370 million in 2017 and new product launch expenses. SGA expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to continued leverage from revenue growth and lower costs in 2016 . SGA expenses in 2015 included costs associated with the separation from Abbott of $265 million , Pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $294 million and litigation reserve charges of $165 million . Additionally, SGA expense in 2015 reflected marketing support for the global launch of VIEKIRA.

These factors were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs of $135 million . RD expenses in 2016 increased from 2015 due primarily to increased funding to support the companys emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets. This increase was partially offset by the following factors: (i) 2015 RD expenses included a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party; (ii) development milestones decreased by $53 million; and (iii) 2015 results included restructuring charges of $32 million. Acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPRD expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2016 . Acquired IPRD expense in 2015 included a charge of $100 million as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C 2 N Diagnostics (C 2 N) to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector and C 2 N agreements. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions)    Interest expense  $ 1,150  $ 1,047  $ Interest income  (146 )  (82 )  (33 ) Interest expense, net  $ 1,004  $ $        Net foreign exchange loss  $  $  $ Other expense, net    Interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan.   2017 Form 10-K  |   35 Interest expense in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics in addition to the incremental expense associated with the May 2016 senior notes issuance discussed above. Interest expense in 2016 also included a debt extinguishment charge of $39 million related to the redemption of the 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. These increases were partially offset by the absence of bridge financing-related costs of $86 million in 2015 incurred in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. Interest income continued to increase in both 2017 and 2016 due to growth in the companys investment securities. Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVies net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation. Net foreign exchange loss in 2015 included losses of $170 million to complete the liquidation of the companys remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with Shire. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities of $626 million in 2017 and $228 million in 2016. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2017, the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. In 2016, the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million . Other expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 31% in 2017 , 24% in 2016 and 23% in 2015 . The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2017 over the prior year was principally due to the estimated tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes. The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates a territorial tax system that includes new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As a result, the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act. The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. The effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions)   Cash flows from:      Operating activities $ 9,960  $ 7,041  $ 7,535 Investing activities (274 )  (6,074 )  (12,936 ) Financing activities (5,512 )  (3,928 )  5,752 Operating cash flows in 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, an improvement in operating earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows in 2016  36    |  2017 Form 10-K   decreased from 2015 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin, offset by income tax payments. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $71 million in 2017 and were presented within operating cash flows as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. Prior to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement, realized excess benefits of $55 million in 2016 and $61 million in 2015 were presented within cash flows from financing activities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie's voluntary contributions, primarily to its principal domestic defined benefit plan of $150 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 . In 2018, AbbVie plans to make voluntary contributions to its various defined benefit plans in excess of $750 million . Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million . Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, a $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016, net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $479 million . Investing activities in 2015 primarily included $11.5 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Pharmacyclics in May 2015 (net of cash acquired of $877 million ). Investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to Calico, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C 2 N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders and $130 million paid to Infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. Cash flows from investing activities in 2015 also included capital expenditures of $532 million . In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $400 million as of December 31, 2017 and $377 million as of December 31, 2016 . AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. In connection with the offering, AbbVie incurred $17 million of issuance costs. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ASR transactions. In connection with the May 2016 issuance of senior notes, AbbVie incurred $52 million of issuance costs. In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. In 2015, the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18.0 billion , 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) as well as $93 million of costs relating to the May 2015 issuance of senior notes. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a three-year $2.0 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2.0 billion term loan credit facility. In November 2015, AbbVie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. Cash dividend payments totaled $4.1 billion in 2017 , $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015 . The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate. On October 27, 2017 , AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.71 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 12, 2018 . This reflects an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly rate. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.71 per share to $0.96 per share beginning with the dividend payable on May 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 13, 2018. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.  In addition to the ASRs, under AbbVie's existing stock repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 , approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 and approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in 2015 . AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016. The stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's   2017 Form 10-K  |   37 discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 . On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase program permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions, including accelerated share repurchases, at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows. Cash and equivalents were impacted by net favorable exchange rate changes totaling $29 million in 2017 , net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 and $300 million in 2015 . The favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, a significant portion of cash and equivalents were considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. The enactment of U.S. tax reform significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system, including imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the creation of a territorial tax system that generally allows the repatriation of future foreign sourced earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes. The company has not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional estimate of the one-time transition tax was $4.5 billion and is generally payable in eight annual installments. AbbVie does not expect the transition tax liability to materially affect its liquidity and capital resources. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, which have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with government health systems. Outstanding governmental receivables in these countries, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, totaled $255 million as of December 31, 2017 and $244 million at December 31, 2016 . The company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries that have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, which may result in delays in the collection of receivables. Outstanding governmental receivables related to Saudi Arabia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $149 million as of December 31, 2017 and $122 million as of December 31, 2016 . Outstanding governmental receivables related to Russia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $152 million as of December 31, 2017 and $110 million as of December 31, 2016 . Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses. Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in oil-exporting countries will have a significant impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of December 31, 2017 . Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $3.0 billion  five -year revolving credit facility which matures in October 2019. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2017 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . 38    |  2017 Form 10-K   Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings There were no changes in the companys credit ratings in 2017. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.   2017 Form 10-K  |   39 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 : (in millions) Total  Less than one year  One to three years  Three to five years  More than five years Short-term borrowings $  $  $   $   $  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 37,612  6,026  5,469  5,938  20,179 Interest on long-term debt (a) 15,617  1,154  2,250  2,080  10,133 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments     Purchase obligations and other (b) 1,135     Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) (f) 10,605  1,135  1,610  1,331  6,529 Total $ 66,326  $ 9,830  $ 9,679  $ 9,546  $ 37,271 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2017 . Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2017 . See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2017 . (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Amounts less than one year includes voluntary contributions in excess of $750 million that AbbVie plans to make to its various defined benefit plans subsequent to December 31, 2017 . Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension and other post-employment benefit plans. (d) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. (e) Includes $4.5 billion of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (f) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform, enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the provisional estimates of these tax liabilities. AbbVie enters into RD collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. 40    |  2017 Form 10-K   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Rebates  AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $12.9 billion in 2017 , $10.8 billion in 2016 and $8.6 billion in 2015 . Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 92% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2017 . Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.

The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2017 . A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 :  50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Defined benefit plans    Service and interest cost $ (64 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (572 )  Other post-employment plans    Service and interest cost $ (9 )  $ Projected benefit obligation (77 )  Effective December 31, 2015, AbbVie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, AbbVie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. In late 2015, AbbVie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. AbbVie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. AbbVie accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. This change reduced AbbVies net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016 . This change had no effect on the 2015 expense and did not affect the measurement of AbbVies total benefit obligations. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2017 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018 . A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2018 by $54 million . The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of 42    |  2017 Form 10-K   December 31, 2017 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018 . A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 :  One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service and interest cost $  $ (24 ) Projected benefit obligation  (140 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPRD acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPRD acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The   2017 Form 10-K  |   43 estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent  Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2017 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $170 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2017 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $390 million .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 :   (in millions) Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)  Contract amount  Weighted average exchange rate  Fair and carrying value receivable Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:            Euro $ 6,366  1.175  $ (88 )  $ 5,544  1.078  $ Japanese yen  112.4    111.6  British pound  1.310  (22 )   1.303  All other currencies 1,877  n/a  (18 )  1,693  n/a  Total $ 9,943    $ (126 )  $ 8,783    $ The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017 . If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. The functional currency of the companys Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the Divisa Complementaria (DICOM) rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2017 , AbbVies net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $509 million at December 31, 2017 . If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates.   2017 Form 10-K  |   45 Market Price Risk AbbVies debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVies policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVies investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2017 . If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the income statement in the period sold. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities AbbVie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $48 million as of December 31, 2017 and $42 million as of December 31, 2016 . AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. In 2017 and 2016 , impairment charges recorded were insignificant. In 2015, AbbVie recorded impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's investments in non-publicly traded equity securities. 46    |  2017 Form 10-K   "," ITEM 8.

AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Background and Basis of Presentation  Background The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States are to three wholesalers. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. AbbVie incurred separation-related expenses of $270 million in 2015, which were principally classified in selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) in the consolidated statements of earnings. Basis of Historical Presentation For a certain portion of AbbVies operations, the legal transfer of AbbVies assets (net of liabilities) did not occur with the separation of AbbVie on January 1, 2013 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and satisfy other regulatory requirements in certain countries. Under the terms of the separation agreement with Abbott, AbbVie was responsible for the business activities conducted by Abbott on its behalf and was subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. As a result, the related assets and liabilities and results of operations were reported in AbbVies consolidated financial statements. All of these operations were transferred to AbbVie as of December 31, 2016. Net revenues related to these operations were insignificant in 2016 and were $213 million in 2015 . Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. All other investments are generally accounted for using the cost method. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Provisions for discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the   2017 Form 10-K  |   53 rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. Historical data is readily available and reliable and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross revenues. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer's normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (RD) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations for pre-commercialization milestones, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to RD expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in SGA in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $846 million in 2017 , $764 million in 2016 and $704 million in 2015 . Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five -year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of time deposits, marketable debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and equity securities. Investments in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges and held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. 54    |  2017 Form 10-K   AbbVie periodically assesses its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie also considers industry factors and general market trends. When AbbVie determines that an other than temporary decline has occurred, a cost basis investment is written down with a charge to other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $58 million at December 31, 2017 and $72 million at December 31, 2016 . Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions)  Finished goods $  $ Work-in-process  1,080 Raw materials  Inventories $ 1,605  $ 1,444 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions)  Land $  $ Buildings 1,428  1,344 Equipment 5,991  5,726 Construction in progress  Property and equipment, gross 8,071  7,526 Less accumulated depreciation (5,268 )  (4,922 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,803  $ 2,604 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $425 million in 2017 , $425 million in 2016 and $417 million in 2015 . Assets related to capital leases were insignificant at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized.   2017 Form 10-K  |   55 Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that r esults of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and  that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.  Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time generally not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, future foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPRD projects acquired are expensed as IPRD in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPRD projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. RD costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. 56    |  2017 Form 10-K   Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter, whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The standard provides clarifying guidance to assist in the evaluation of whether transactions are treated as business combinations or asset acquisitions. AbbVie elected to early adopt the changes prospectively in the first quarter of 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, all excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards are recognized in the statement of earnings when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders' equity. In addition, excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows are now classified as an operating activity rather than as a financing activity. AbbVie adopted these changes prospectively. Accordingly, the company recognized excess tax benefits in income tax expense of $71 million in 2017 and classified them within cash flows from operating activities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) . The amendments in this standard supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AbbVie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. AbbVie will adopt the standard effective the first quarter of 2018 and apply the amendments using the modified retrospective method. The company has completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2017. AbbVie does not expect significant changes to the amounts or timing of revenue recognition for product sales, which is its primary revenue stream. However, the adoption of the new standard will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 of approximately $120 million , net of tax, primarily related to certain deferred license revenues that were originally expected to be recognized through early 2020. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. These provisions will not impact the accounting for AbbVie's investments in debt securities. The new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current U.S. GAAP. Amendments are to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. This standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the   2017 Form 10-K  |   57 first quarter of 2018. Based on historical trends, AbbVie does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The standard outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model that supersedes the current lease guidance and requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The new standard must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. AbbVie will adopt the standard effective in the first quarter of 2019 and is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. Additionally, the standard requires new disclosures and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019 is permitted. With certain exceptions, adjustments are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach by reflecting adjustments through a cumulative-effect impact to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The new standard requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current U.S. GAAP, the income tax consequences of these intercompany asset transfers are deferred until the asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2018. Adjustments for this update are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The company has completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2017 . The adoption will require a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 of approximately $1.8 billion related to prepaid income tax assets that will be affected by this standard, of which $1.4 billion was included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 . In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . The standard requires that an employer continue to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item or items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately outside of income from operations and are not eligible for capitalization. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2018. Upon adoption, the company will apply the income statement classification provisions of this standard retrospectively and will reclassify income of $47 million from operating earnings to non-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the company preliminarily expects to record approximately $20 million of non-operating income in 2018 which would have been recorded in operating earnings under the previous guidance. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . The standard simplifies the application of hedge accounting and more closely aligns the accounting with an entitys risk management activities. AbbVie will early adopt the standard effective in the first quarter of 2018 and does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 58    |  2017 Form 10-K   Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information  Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions)   Interest expense $ 1,150  $ 1,047  $ Interest income (146 )  (82 )  (33 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,004  $  $ Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Sales rebates $ 3,069  $ 2,887 Accounts payable 1,474  1,407 Dividends payable 1,143  1,028 Salaries, wages and commissions  Royalty and license arrangements  Other 3,263  2,979 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 10,226  $ 9,379 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Contingent consideration liabilities $ 4,266  $ 3,941 Pension and other post-employment benefits 2,740  2,085 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 2,683  1,166 Income taxes payable 4,675   Other 1,241  1,160 Other long-term liabilities $ 15,605  $ 8,352 Note 4 Earnings Per Share  AbbVie grants certain restricted stock awards (RSAs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive.   2017 Form 10-K  |   59 The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:  Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share information)   Basic EPS      Net earnings $ 5,309  $ 5,953  $ 5,144 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,283 $ 5,923 $ 5,118 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,596  1,622  1,625 Basic earnings per share $ 3.31  $ 3.65  $ 3.15       Diluted EPS      Net earnings $ 5,309  $ 5,953  $ 5,144 Earnings allocated to participating securities   Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,283  $ 5,923  $ 5,118 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,596  1,622  1,625 Effect of dilutive securities   Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,603  1,631  1,637 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.30  $ 3.63  $ 3.13 As further described in Note 12 , AbbVie entered into and executed an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with third party financial institutions in 2016 and 2015. For purposes of calculating EPS, AbbVie reflected the ASR as a repurchase of AbbVie common stock in the relevant periods. Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements  Acquisition of Stemcentrx On June 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Stemcentrx, a privately-held biotechnology company. The transaction expanded AbbVies oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer. The acquisition of Stemcentrx was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.  The aggregate upfront consideration for the acquisition of Stemcentrx consisted of approximately 62.4 million shares of AbbVie common stock, issued from common stock held in treasury, and cash. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development and regulatory milestones. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was $4.0 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $620 million and was estimated using a combination of probability-weighted discounted cash flow models and Monte Carlo simulation models. The estimate was determined based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, referred to as Level 3 inputs, as described in more detail in Note 10 . The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions)  Cash $ 1,883 Fair value of AbbVie common stock 3,923 Contingent consideration Total consideration $ 6,426 60    |  2017 Form 10-K   The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the June 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions)  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Accounts receivable $ Prepaid expenses and other Property and equipment Intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development 6,100 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (31 ) Deferred income taxes (1,933 ) Other long-term liabilities (7 ) Total identifiable net assets 4,154 Goodwill 2,272 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 6,426 Intangible assets were related to IPRD for Rova-T, four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and several additional pre-clinical compounds. The estimated fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated annual cash flows for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, RD costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each assets life cycle, the regulatory approval probabilities, commercial success risks, competitive landscape as well as other factors. The goodwill recognized represents expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) leverage the respective strengths of each business; (ii) expand the combined companys product portfolio; (iii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology; and (iv) establish a strong leadership position in oncology. Goodwill was also impacted by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Stemcentrx have been included in the company's financial statements. AbbVies consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 included no net revenues and an operating loss of $165 million associated with Stemcentrx's operations. This operating loss included $43 million of post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense for Stemcentrx options and excluded interest expense and certain acquisition costs. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of AbbVie and Stemcentrx for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as if the acquisition of Stemcentrx had occurred on January 1, 2015:  Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share information)  Net revenues $ 25,641  $ 22,869 Net earnings 5,907  4,894 Basic earnings per share $ 3.58  $ 2.90 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.56  $ 2.88 The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Stemcentrx. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2015 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition and the reclassification of acquisition,   2017 Form 10-K  |   61 integration and financing-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of the future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition. Acquisition of BI 655066 and BI 655064 from Boehringer Ingelheim On April 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab (BI 655066), an anti-IL-23 monoclonal biologic antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, from Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. AbbVie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in other indications, including Crohns disease, psoriatic arthritis and asthma. In addition to risankizumab, AbbVie also gained rights to an anti-CD40 antibody, BI 655064, currently in Phase 1 development. BI will retain responsibility for further development of BI 655064, and AbbVie may elect to advance the program after completion of certain clinical achievements. The acquired assets include all patents, data, know-how, third-party agreements, regulatory filings and manufacturing technology related to BI 655066 and BI 655064. The company concluded that the acquired assets met the definition of a business and accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $595 million . Additionally, $18 million of payments to BI, pursuant to a contractual obligation to reimburse BI for certain development costs it incurred prior to the acquisition date, were initially deferred. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments based on net revenues of licensed products. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was approximately $1.6 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $606 million . The acquisition-date fair value of contingent royalty payments was $2.8 billion . The potential contingent consideration payments were estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which were then discounted to present value. The fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs. The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions)  Cash $ Deferred consideration payable Contingent consideration 3,365 Total consideration $ 3,978 The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired as of the April 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions)  Assets acquired  Identifiable intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development $ 3,890 Goodwill Total assets acquired $ 3,978 The estimated fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the income approach. The goodwill recognized represents expected synergies, including an expansion of the companys immunology product portfolio. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because this acquisition is insignificant to AbbVies consolidated results of operations. Acquisition of Pharmacyclics On May 26, 2015, AbbVie acquired Pharmacyclics, a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes novel therapies for people impacted by cancer. Pharmacyclics markets IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, targeting B-cell malignancies. 62    |  2017 Form 10-K   The acquisition of Pharmacyclics was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total consideration for the acquisition of Pharmacyclics consisted of cash and approximately 128 million shares of AbbVie common stock and is summarized as follows: (in millions)  Cash $ 12,365 Fair value of AbbVie common stock 8,405 Total consideration $ 20,770 The following table summarizes the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the May 26, 2015 acquisition date: (in millions)  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Cash and equivalents $ Short-term investments Accounts receivable Inventories Other assets Intangible assets  Definite-lived developed product rights 4,590 Definite-lived license agreements 6,780 Indefinite-lived research and development 7,180 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (381 ) Deferred income taxes (6,453 ) Other long-term liabilities (254 ) Total identifiable net assets 13,160 Goodwill 7,610 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 20,770 The amortization of the fair market value step-up fo r acquired inventory was included in cost of products sold and RD in the consolidated statements of earnings. The related amortization was $58 million in 2017 , $274 million in 2016 and $113 million in 2015. Intangible assets were related to the IMBRUVICA developed product rights, IPRD in the United States for additional IMBRUVICA indications and the contractual rights to IMBRUVICA profits and losses outside the United States as a result of the collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson  Johnson. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the collaboration with Janssen. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair value of the IPRD and identifiable intangible assets was determined using the ""income approach."" The goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Pharmacyclics includes expected synergies, including the ability to leverage the respective strengths of each business, expanding the combined company's product portfolio, acceleration of clinical and commercial presence in oncology and establishment of a strong leadership position in hematological oncology. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. From the acquisition date through December 31, 2015, AbbVie's 2015 consolidated statement of earnings included net revenues of $774 million and an operating loss of $519 million associated with Pharmacyclics' operations. The operating loss included $346 million of acquisition-related compensation expense, $261 million of inventory step-up and intangible asset amortization and $100 million of transaction and integration costs. Of these costs, $294 million was recorded within SGA expenses, $152 million within RD expense and $261 million within cost of products sold in the 2015 consolidated statement of earnings.   2017 Form 10-K  |   63 Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of AbbVie and Pharmacyclics for 2015 as if the acquisition of Pharmacyclics had occurred on January 1, 2014: year ended December 31 (in millions, except per share information) Net revenues $ 23,215 Net earnings 5,345 Basic earnings per share $ 3.18 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.16 The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Pharmacyclics. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2014 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with the acquisition-date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition, integration and financing-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2014. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of the future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition. Other Licensing  Acquisitions Activity Excluding the acquisitions above, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $308 million in 2017 , $262 million in 2016 and $964 million in 2015 . AbbVie recorded IPRD charges of $327 million in 2017 , $200 million in 2016 and $150 million in 2015 . Significant arrangements impacting 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. Alector, Inc. In October 2017, AbbVie entered into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets and AbbVie has an option to global development and commercial rights to two targets. The terms of the arrangement included an initial upfront payment of $205 million , which was expensed to IPRD in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alector will conduct exploratory research, drug discovery and development for lead programs up to the conclusion of the proof of concept studies. If the option is exercised, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities and could make additional payments to Alector of up to $986 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Alector and AbbVie will co-fund development and commercialization and will share global profits equally. C 2 N Diagnostics In March 2015, AbbVie entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C 2 N Diagnostics (C 2 N) to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. As part of the agreement, AbbVie made an initial upfront payment of $100 million , which was expensed to IPRD in 2015. AbbVie made additional payments of $35 million in both 2016 and 2017, which were recorded in RD expense, due to the achievement of development milestones under the license agreement. Upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $615 million , as well as royalties on net revenues. Other Arrangements In addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPRD of $122 million in 2017 , $200 million in 2016 and $50 million in 2015 . In connection with the other individually insignificant early stage arrangements entered into in 2017 , AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $2.4 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 64    |  2017 Form 10-K   Other Activity Priority Review Voucher (PRV) In August 2015, AbbVie entered into an agreement to purchase a rare pediatric disease PRV from a third party. The PRV entitles AbbVie to receive an FDA priority review of a single New Drug Application or Biologics License Application, which reduces the target review time and could lead to an expedited approval. In exchange for the PRV, AbbVie made a payment of $350 million , which was recorded in RD expense in the consolidated statement of earnings and as an operating cash outflow in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2015. AbbVie intends to use the PRV for an existing RD project. Note 6 Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.  In December 2011, Pharmacyclics entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen for the joint development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of BTK and certain compounds structurally related to IMBRUVICA, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs. In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of IMBRUVICA are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie: years ended December 31 (in millions)    United States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold)  $ 1,001  $  $ International - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues)    Global - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items)      2017 Form 10-K  |   65 Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill: (in millions)  Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 13,168 Additions (see Note 5) 2,360 Foreign currency translation (112 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 15,416 Foreign currency translation Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 15,785 The latest impairment assessment of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of 2017 . As of December 31, 2017 , there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Future impairment tests for goodwill will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist.

Amortization expense was $1.1 billion in 2017 , $764 million in 2016 and $419 million in 2015 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2017 is as follows: (in billions)     Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 1.3  $ 1.5  $ 1.7  $ 1.9  $ 2.1 In 2017, an impairment charge of $354 million was recorded related to ZINBRYTA that reduced both the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of the underlying intangible assets due to lower expected future cash flows for the product. In 2016, an impairment charge of $39 million was recorded related to certain developed product rights in the United States due to a decline in the market for the product. In 2015, no intangible asset impairment charges were recorded. The 2017 and 2016 impairment charges were based on discounted cash flow analyses and were included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPRD associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. Indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. See Note 5 for additional information. The latest impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed in the third quarter of 2017 . No impairment charges were recorded in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Future impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. 66    |  2017 Form 10-K   Note 8 Restructuring Plans  AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and RD operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment, for example, in conjunction with the loss and expected loss of exclusivity of certain products. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $86 million in 2017 , $52 million in 2016 and $138 million in 2015 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded in cost of products sold, RD expense and SGA expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on classification of the affected employees or operations. The following summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : (in millions)  Accrued balance at December 31, 2014 $ 2015 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (100 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2015 2016 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (113 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2016 2017 restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments (87 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 $   2017 Form 10-K  |   67 Note 9 Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies  The following table summarizes long-term debt: as of December 31 (dollars in millions) Effective interest rate in 2017 (a)   Effective interest rate in 2016 (a)  Senior notes issued in 2012        2.00% notes due 2018 2.15 %  1,000  2.15 %  1,000 2.90% notes due 2022 2.97 %  3,100  2.97 %  3,100 4.40% notes due 2042 4.46 %  2,600  4.46 %  2,600 Senior notes issued in 2015        1.80% notes due 2018 1.92 %  3,000  1.92 %  3,000 2.50% notes due 2020 2.65 %  3,750  2.65 %  3,750 3.20% notes due 2022 3.28 %  1,000  3.28 %  1,000 3.60% notes due 2025 3.66 %  3,750  3.66 %  3,750 4.50% notes due 2035 4.58 %  2,500  4.58 %  2,500 4.70% notes due 2045 4.73 %  2,700  4.73 %  2,700 Senior notes issued in 2016        2.30% notes due 2021 2.40 %  1,800  2.40 %  1,800 2.85% notes due 2023 2.91 %  1,000  2.91 %  1,000 3.20% notes due 2026 3.28 %  2,000  3.28 %  2,000 4.30% notes due 2036 4.37 %  1,000  4.37 %  1,000 4.45% notes due 2046 4.50 %  2,000  4.50 %  2,000 Senior Euro notes issued in 2016        0.38% notes due 2019 (1,400 principal) 0.55 %  1,673  0.55 %  1,464 1.38% notes due 2024 (1,450 principal) 1.46 %  1,733  1.46 %  1,516 2.13% notes due 2028 (750 principal) 2.18 %   2.18 %  Term loan facilities        Floating rate notes due 2018 2.26 %  2,000  1.64 %  2,000 Other    Fair value hedges   (401 )    (338 ) Unamortized bond discounts   (97 )    (110 ) Unamortized deferred financing costs   (146 )    (164 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations   36,968    36,465 Current portion   6,015    Noncurrent portion   $ 30,953    $ 36,440 (a) Excludes the effect of any related interest rate swaps. In November 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and three months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs totaled $17 million and debt discounts incurred totaled $9 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. As a result of this redemption, the company incurred a charge of $39 million ( $25 million after tax) related to the make-whole premium, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses. The charge was recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. 68    |  2017 Form 10-K   In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs totaled $52 million and debt discounts incurred totaled $29 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Of the $7.7 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the companys outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion was used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion was used to finance an ASR with a third party financial institution. See Note 5 for additional information related to the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a $2.0 billion  three -year term loan credit agreement and a $2.0 billion  364 -day term loan credit agreement (collectively, the term loan facilities). In November 2015, AbbVie drew on these term loan facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in November 2015. In connection with the May 2016 unsecured senior notes issuance, AbbVie repaid the 364 -day term loan credit agreement. The borrowings under the term loan facilities bear interest at variable rates which are adjusted based on AbbVie's public debt ratings. In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. The senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium and, except for the 1.80% notes due 2018, AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the offering totaled $93 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and approximately $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR with a third party financial institution. See Note 5 for additional information related to the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. In March 2015, AbbVie entered into an $18.0 billion bridge loan in support of the then planned acquisition of Pharmacyclics. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the company's May 2015 senior notes issuance. Interest expense, net in 2015 included $86 million of costs related to the bridge loan. AbbVie has outstanding $6.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2012. AbbVie may redeem all of the senior notes of each series, at any time, or some of the senior notes of each series, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. At December 31, 2017 , the company was in compliance with its senior note covenants and term loan covenants. Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings included commercial paper borrowings of $400 million at December 31, 2017 and $377 million at December 31, 2016 . The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 1.3% in 2017 , 0.6% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015 . In October 2014, AbbVie entered into a $3.0 billion  five -year revolving credit facility, which matures in October 2019. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2017 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .   2017 Form 10-K  |   69 Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, debt maturities and future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2017 : as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) Operating leases  Debt maturities and capital leases $  $ 6,026 126  1,698 109  3,771 85  1,836 66  4,102 Thereafter  20,179 Total obligations and commitments  37,612 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond discounts and deferred financing costs  (644 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations $  $ 36,968 Lease expense was $169 million in 2017 , $159 million in 2016 and $146 million in 2015 . AbbVie's operating leases generally include renewal options and provide for the company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs of the leased property. As of December 31, 2017 , annual future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations were insignificant. Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 10 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures  Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps, in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 , are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2017 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of 70    |  2017 Form 10-K   earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $7.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and $6.6 billion at December 31, 2016 . The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company issued 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes and designated the principal amounts of this foreign denominated debt as net investment hedges. Concurrently, the company settled foreign currency forward exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of 3.5 billion that were designated as net investment hedges. AbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $11.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $11.8 billion at December 31, 2016 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie's derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets:  Fair value - Derivatives in asset position  Fair value - Derivatives in liability position as of December 31 (in millions) Balance sheet caption 2016  Balance sheet caption 2016 Foreign currency forward exchange contracts        Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other $ $  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ $ Not designated as hedges Prepaid expenses and other 55  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 33 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Prepaid expenses and other    Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Other assets    Other long-term liabilities 338 Total derivatives  $ $   $ $ While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company's counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

Assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, the company expects to transfer pre-tax unrealized losses of $174 million into cost of products sold for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months. The company recognized, in other comprehensive loss, pre-tax losses of $537 million in 2017 and pre-tax gains of $101 million in 2016 related to non-derivative, foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges.   2017 Form 10-K  |   71 The following table summarizes the pre-tax amounts and location of derivative instrument net gains (losses) recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings, including the effective portions of the net gains (losses) reclassified out of AOCI into net earnings.

Fair Value Measures The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:  Level 1Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access;  Level 2Valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; and  Level 3Valuations using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and include the use of judgment by the company's management about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities were determined based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. Available-for-sale equity securities consists of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using publicized spot curves for interest rate hedges and publicized forward curves for foreign currency contracts. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2017 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $170 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2017 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $390 million .  There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions)   Beginning balance  $ 4,213  $  Additions (See Note 5)    3,985 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings   Milestone payments  (305 )   Ending balance  $ 4,534  $ 4,213  The change in fair value recognized in net earnings was recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings in 2017 and 2016 .   2017 Form 10-K  |   73 In addition to the financial instruments that the company carries at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The fair values of short-term borrowings approximate the carrying values due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair values of long-term debt, excluding fair value hedges and the term loans, were determined by using the published market price for the debt instruments, without consideration of transaction costs, which represents a Level 1 basis of fair value measurement. The fair values of the term loans were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using quoted market rates, which represents a Level 2 basis of fair value measurement. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. 74    |  2017 Form 10-K   Available-for-sale Securities Substantially all of the companys investments in debt and equity securities were classified as available-for-sale. Debt securities classified as short-term were $482 million as of December 31, 2017 and $309 million as of December 31, 2016 . Long-term debt securities mature primarily within five years . Estimated fair values of available-for-sale securities were based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services.

Net realized gains were $90 million in 2017 . Net realized gains in 2016 and 2015 were insignificant. Concentrations of Risk The company invests excess cash in time deposits, money market funds and debt securities to diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. The company has established credit exposure limits and monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institution deposits. The functional currency of the company's Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the Divisa Complementaria (DICOM) rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , AbbVies net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, which have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions. Substantially all of AbbVies trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with government health systems. Outstanding governmental receivables in these countries, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, totaled $255 million as of December 31, 2017 and $244 million as of December 31, 2016 . The company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries that have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, which may result in delays in the collection of receivables. Outstanding governmental receivables related to Saudi Arabia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $149 million as of December 31, 2017 and $122 million at December 31, 2016 . Outstanding governmental receivables related to Russia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $152 million as of December 31, 2017 and $110 million as of December 31, 2016 . Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses.   2017 Form 10-K  |   75 Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 56% as of December 31, 2017 and 51% as of December 31, 2016 , and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 65% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2017 , 63% in 2016 and 61% in 2015 . Note 11 Post-Employment Benefits  AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 . AbbVie's principal domestic defined benefit plan is the AbbVie Pension Plan. AbbVie made voluntary contributions of $150 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 to this plan. In 2018, AbbVie plans to make voluntary contributions to its various defined benefit plans in excess of $750 million .

Historically, AbbVie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. In late 2015, AbbVie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. AbbVie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. AbbVie accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. This change reduced AbbVie's net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016 . This change had no effect on the 2015 expense and did not affect the measurement of AbbVie's total benefit obligations. For the December 31, 2017 post-retirement health care obligations remeasurement, the company assumed a 7.7% pre-65 ( 9.5% post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% in 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2017 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 6.8% pre-65 ( 7.8% post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% for 2064 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2017 , a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:  One percentage point year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase  Decrease Service cost and interest cost $  $ (9 ) Projected benefit obligation  (140 ) 78    |  2017 Form 10-K   Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets    Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)     Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)     Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 1,715  $ 1,208  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 3,684       Fair value of plan assets $ 5,399       Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions)  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)  Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)  Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities        U.S. large cap (a) $  $  $   $  U.S. mid cap (b)      International (c)      Fixed income securities        U.S. government securities (d)      Corporate debt instruments (d)     Non-U.S. government securities (d)    Other (d)     Absolute return funds (e)     Real assets      Other (f)      Total $ 1,552  $ 1,145  $  $  Total assets measured at NAV 3,020       Fair value of plan assets $ 4,572    (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The target investment allocations for the AbbVie Pension Plan is 35% in equity securities, 20% in fixed income securities and 45% in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans  Other post-employment plans $  $ 2019  2020  2021  2022  2023 to 2027 1,474  Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plan is the AbbVie Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $82 million in 2017 , $75 million in 2016 and $73 million in 2015 related to this plan. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. 80    |  2017 Form 10-K   Note 12 Equity  Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbotts incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least ten years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows:  Years ended December 31, (in millions)   Cost of products sold $  $  $ Research and development   Selling, general and administrative   Pre-tax compensation expense   Tax benefit   After-tax compensation expense $  $  $ Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included the post-combination impact related to Stemcentrx options. See Note 5 for additional information related to the Stemcentrx acquisition. The realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $71 million in 2017 , $55 million in 2016 and $61 million in 2015 . Beginning in 2017, all excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards are recognized in the statement of earnings when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders' equity as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. Stock Options Stock options awarded pursuant to the 2013 ISP typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100% of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $9.80 in 2017 , $9.29 in 2016 and $9.96 in 2015 .   2017 Form 10-K  |   81 The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2017 : (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options  Weighted- average exercise price  Weighted- average remaining life (in years)  Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2016 15,962  $ 33.63  3.7  $ Granted 1,241  61.36     Exercised (8,836 )  30.06     Lapsed (51 )  32.58     Outstanding at December 31, 2017 8,316  $ 41.69  5.1  $ Exercisable at December 31, 2017 5,661  $ 35.51  3.6  $ The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $371 million in 2017 , $325 million in 2016 and $216 million in 2015 . The total fair value of options vested during 2017 was $32 million . On June 1, 2016, AbbVie issued stock options for 1.1 million AbbVie shares to holders of unvested Stemcentrx options as a result of the conversion of such options in connection with the Stemcentrx acquisition. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. See Note 5 for additional information related to the Stemcentrx acquisition. As of December 31, 2017 , $14 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSAs, RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees pursuant to the 2013 ISP generally vest in one-third increments over a three year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees under the 2013 ISP are performance-based. Such awards granted before 2016 consisted of RSAs (or RSUs to the extent necessary for global employees) that generally vest in one-third increments over a three -to- five year period, with vesting contingent upon AbbVie achieving a minimum annual return on equity (ROE). Recipients are entitled to receive dividends (or dividend equivalents for RSUs) as dividends are declared and paid during the award vesting period. In 2016, AbbVie redesigned certain aspects of its long-term incentive program. As a result, equity awards granted in 2016 and 2017 to senior executives and other key employees consisted of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three -year performance period based on AbbVies ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three -year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVies EPS achievement and AbbVies total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs, RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVies common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 82    |  2017 Form 10-K   The following table summarizes AbbVie RSA, RSU and performance share activity for 2017 : (share units in thousands) Share units  Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2016 10,715  $ 56.47 Granted 6,109  61.89 Vested (5,532 )  56.34 Forfeited (610 )  59.50 Outstanding at December 31, 2017 10,682  $ 59.47 The fair market value of RSAs, RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $348 million in 2017 , $362 million in 2016 and $335 million in 2015 . As of December 31, 2017 , $250 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs, RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years.

Stock Repurchase Program The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie's board of directors authorized increases to its existing stock repurchase program of $4.0 billion in April 2016 in anticipation of executing an ASR in connection with the Stemcentrx acquisition and of $5.0 billion in March 2015 in anticipation of executing an ASR in connection with the Pharmacyclics acquisition.

AbbVie's remaining share repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 . On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase program permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions, including accelerated share repurchases, at managements discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time.    2017 Form 10-K  |   83 In addition to the ASRs, AbbVie repurchased on the open market approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 , 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 and 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in 2015 .

These losses were included in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statement of earnings and had no related income tax impacts. Other comprehensive loss in 2017 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $680 million , which was principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss in 2016 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $165 million , which was principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the companys Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss in 2015 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $667 million , which was principally driven by the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets. 84    |  2017 Form 10-K   The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains)   Pension and post-employment benefits      Amortization of actuarial losses and other (a) $  $  $ Tax benefit (33 )  (26 )  (46 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $  $  $       Cash flow hedging activities      Losses (gains) on designated cash flow hedges (b) $ (118 )  $ (20 )  $ (265 ) Tax expense (benefit)  (4 )  Total reclassifications, net of tax $ (112 )  $ (24 )  $ (259 ) (a) Amounts are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 11 ).

The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. These changes are effective beginning in 2018.   2017 Form 10-K  |   85 Prior to the enactment of the Act, the company did not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Due to the provision of the Act that requires a one-time deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the company no longer considers those earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. The transition tax expense on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was $4.5 billion , generally payable in eight annual installments. Additionally, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit of U.S. tax reform from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes was $3.6 billion . Given the complexity of the Act and anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Act, the companys analysis and accounting for the tax effects of the Act is preliminary. As a direct result of the Act, the company recorded $4.5 billion of transition tax expense, as well as $4.1 billion of net tax benefit for deferred tax remeasurement. Both of these amounts are provisional estimates, as the company has not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax or its analysis of certain other aspects of the Act that could result in adjustments to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. Upon completion of the analysis in 2018, these estimates may be adjusted through income tax expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.

The effective income tax rates in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to changes in enacted tax rates and laws, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and the cost of repatriation decisions. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2017 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. In addition, in 2017, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $91 million related to the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. The effective income tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. The effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. 86    |  2017 Form 10-K   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions)  Deferred tax assets    Compensation and employee benefits $  $ Accruals and reserves  Chargebacks and rebates  Deferred revenue  Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards  Other  Total deferred tax assets 2,032  2,447 Valuation allowances (108 )  (76 ) Total net deferred tax assets 1,924  2,371 Deferred tax liabilities    Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets (3,762 )  (5,487 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments (181 )  (3,367 ) Other (203 )  (182 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (4,146 )  (9,036 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ (2,222 )  $ (6,665 ) The decreases in deferred tax assets and liabilities were primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. tax reform that reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system, which will generally allow repatriation of future foreign sourced earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The taxability of the foreign sourced earnings and the applicable tax rates are dependent on future events. While the company is still evaluating its accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings, the provisional estimates of the tax effects of the Act were reported on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. As of December 31, 2017 , gross state net operating losses were $1.2 billion and tax credit carryforwards were $228 million . The state tax carryforwards expire between 2018 and 2038. As of December 31, 2017 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $209 million . Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $155 million expire between 2018 and 2027 and the remaining do not have an expiration period. The company had valuation allowances of $108 million as of December 31, 2017 and $76 million as of December 31, 2016 . These were principally related to state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Current income taxes receivable were $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $347 million as of December 31, 2016 and were included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets.

AbbVie will be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $2.6 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016 . Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2017 , AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $85 million . The Increases due to current year tax positions in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items, including a provisional estimate of the remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to earnings of foreign subsidiaries following the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017. The ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above includes amounts relating to federal, state and international items as well as prior positions acquired through business development activities during the year. Uncertain tax positions are generally included as a long-term liability on the consolidated balance sheets. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $24 million in 2017 , $35 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015 , for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $120 million at December 31, 2017 , $112 million at December 31, 2016 and $83 million at December 31, 2015 . The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months up to $31 million . All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2008. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.  Note 14 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $445 million as of December 31, 2017 and approximately $225 million at December 31, 2016 . Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVies consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Several pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvay's patent litigation involving AndroGel was sham litigation and the 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. These cases include: (a) four individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) three purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. et al. Following the district court's dismissal of all plaintiffs' claims, appellate proceedings led to the reinstatement of the claims regarding the patent litigation settlements, which are proceeding in the district court. 88    |  2017 Form 10-K   Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by three named direct purchasers of Niaspan and the other brought by ten named end-payer purchasers of Niaspan. The cases are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the State of California filed a lawsuit regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys fees. In September 2014, the FTC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against AbbVie and others, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the patent litigation settlement with one of those generic companies violates federal antitrust laws. The FTC's complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC's claim regarding the patent litigation settlement. In March 2015, the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit, State of Louisiana v. Fournier Industrie et Sante, et al., against AbbVie, Abbott and affiliated Abbott entities in Louisiana state court. Plaintiff alleges that patent applications and patent litigation filed and other alleged conduct from the early 2000's and before related to the drug TriCor violated Louisiana State antitrust and unfair trade practices laws. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and attorneys' fees. In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payers who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted include violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 4,300 claims are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation, MDL No. 2545. Approximately 210 claims are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In July 2017, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois reached a verdict in the first case to be tried. The jury found for AbbVie on the plaintiff's strict liability and negligence claims and for the plaintiff on the plaintiff's fraud claim. The jury awarded no compensatory damages, but did award plaintiffs $150 million in punitive damages. In December 2017, the court vacated the jurys verdict and punitive damage award on the fraud claim and ordered a new trial on that claim. In a second case, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois reached a verdict for AbbVie in August 2017 on all claims, which is the subject of post-trial proceedings. In another case, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois reached a verdict for AbbVie in October 2017 on strict liability but for the plaintiff on remaining claims and awarded $140,000 in compensatory damages and $140 million in punitive damages, which is the subject of post-trial proceedings.

Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In May 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Ellis v. Gonzalez, et al., was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that AbbVie's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with statements made regarding the Shire transaction. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages for AbbVie, among other relief. Beginning in May 2016, the Patent Trial  Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent  Trademark Office (PTO) instituted five inter partes review proceedings brought by Coherus Biosciences and Boehringer Ingelheim related to three AbbVie patents covering methods of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis using adalimumab. In these proceedings, the PTO reviewed the validity of the patents and issued decisions of invalidity in May, June and July of 2017. AbbVies appeal of the decisions is pending in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, AbbVie filed a lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. v. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. and Grifols Worldwide Operations Ltd., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Novartis Vaccines and Grifols Worldwide seeking a declaratory judgment that eleven HCV-related patents licensed to AbbVie in 2002 are invalid. AbbVie is seeking to enforce certain patent rights related to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark HUMIRA). In a case filed in United States District Court for the District of Delaware in August 2017, AbbVie alleges that Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbHs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical, Inc.s, and Boehringer Ingelheim Fremont, Inc.s proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Chicago, Illinois February 16, 2018  94    |  2017 Form 10-K   "," ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, William J. Chase, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 . Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .   2017 Form 10-K  |   95 Report of independent registered public accounting firm.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis of Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 16, 2018    2017 Form 10-K  |   97 "
