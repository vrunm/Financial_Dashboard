| Model | Accuracy | F1 | AUC |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------------ | 
| Roberta | 0.662 | 0.656 | 0.628 |
| FinBERT | 0.746 | 0.682 | 0.721 | 
| DistilBERT | 0.911 | 0.914 | 0.972 |

## **Summarization**

For the summarization task, the data of Pfizer, Costco and Meta was labeled and used. A local cross validation split was created by randomly sampling rows from the records of these companies.
Text summarization was carried out using these three transformers models:

The T5, DistilPEGASUS and DistilBART models were fine-tuned for summarization. The best results were obtained using the fine-tuned **DistilBART** model. It achieved an ROUGE-L Score of 67.7%.


| Model | ROUGUE-1 | ROUGUE-2 | ROUGUE-L | ROUGUE-LSUM
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------|
| T5| 32.22 | 28.5 | 31.5| 31.5 | 31.5 |
| DistilPEGASUS | 48.32 | 34.48 |43.51| 31.50 |
| DistilBART | 72.28 | 61.15 | 67.70 | 71 |
